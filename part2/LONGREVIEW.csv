10113,"Star Trek: The Motion Picture ","A long time ago in a strange place called Hollywood, a theatrical cut of a movie was considered to be the director's cut. Now, with the advent of DVDs and the proliferation of special editions, numerous big-budget (and some not-so-big-budget) motion pictures are being given a second life in a format that is often quite different from the original version. For filmmakers who continuously like to tinker, this new philosophy is a godsend. They can release a truncated, studio-friendly version in theaters, then offer their ""true vision"" to DVD buyers.

This trend towards director's cuts/special editions was not started by George Lucas, but it was popularized by him. The financial windfall reaped when Lucas re-released the original three Star Wars films with new effects and footage awakened Hollywood executives to a previously-untapped resource. To be fair, most special editions exist primarily for creative reasons (although the studios backing them dream of $$$), and often result in a vastly improved product. James Cameron's The Abyss is a completely different movie - confusing and dissatisfying in the shortened theatrical version; sublime and brilliant in the director's cut. The hour added to Wolgang Petersen's Das Boot transforms it into a character-driven white-knuckler. Cameron Crowe's extended Almost Famous gives the story greater span and depth.

In 1979, the release of Star Trek - The Motion Picture represented the climax to every Star Trek fan's wet dream. The date, December 7, lived in infamy for the entire production crew. Paramount Pictures etched this date into their release calendar and informed everyone involved that the film would be ready on that day. Despite the Herculean effort by legendary director Robert Wise and his army of post-production assistants, the version of Star Trek - The Motion Picture that reached theaters was not complete. Effects scenes were unfinished, the sound mix was not perfected, and several important sequences were inexplicably left on the cutting room floor.

The movie that played in theaters during late 1979 and early 1980 received a mixed critical and popular reception. Star Trek fans were divided over the film. On one hand, it gave them the opportunity to spend time with characters who were as dear to them as old friends. On the other hand, it was largely a re-hash of previously-produced television episodes (in particular, ""The Changeling""). The general public, expecting a Star Wars clone and instead getting something more sedate and less action-oriented, was bored. Two unflattering nicknames were born: Star Trek - The Motionless Picture and Star Trek - The Motion Sickness. The movie was a financial success, grossing nearly $90 million domestically (against a $35 million budget), but a large portion of that was contributed by Trekkers who returned time and time again to theaters to re-watch the movie. It was not unusual to find die-hards who would proudly claim to have seen Star Trek - The Motion Picture 40, 50, or even 100 times. (This kind of repeat business, unheard of in the era of home video, did occasionally happen.)

The film opens with the destruction of three Klingon warships by a mysterious energy cloud that is on a direct heading for Earth. The newly redesigned U.S.S. Enterprise, the pride and joy of the United Federation of Planets, is the only ship available to intercept the cloud, and it hasn't undergone its shakedown cruise. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), restless after 2 1/2 years behind a desk, uses the crises to once again take command of the Enterprise, forcing the ship's expected captain, Will Decker (Stephen Collins), into the role of Executive Officer. Most of the crew is re-united, including the irascible Dr. McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley) and the half-Vulcan Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy). Spock senses a kinship with the vast consciousness that exists at the heart of the cloud. Also on board are Chief Engineer Scotty (James Doohan), Security Chief Chekov (Walter Koenig), Helmsman Sulu (George Takei), Communications Officer Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and a newcomer, Navigator Ilia (Persis Khambatta).

After battling several systems failures, including a malfunctioning transporter that kills two crewman and a propulsion system that becomes unstable and creates a wormhole, the Enterprise makes contact with the entity within the cloud, called V'ger. The journey to the center of the alien ship is a strange and bizarre one. Ilia is killed when a probe invades the Enterprise bridge, and V'ger later sends a second probe to the ship in the form of a mechanism that mimics Ilia's body and features. Kirk learns that V'ger is a living machine traveling to Earth to make contact with its ""Creator"". If this contact is not made, V'ger intends to wipe out all of the human beings ""infesting"" the planet. It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to prevent that eventuality.

My recollections of seeing Star Trek - The Motion Picture during its initial release are of watching a lot of pretty images pass across the screen. The special effects sequences seemed to go on forever, with only an occasional glimpse of the actors reacting to what their characters were supposedly seeing. Subsequent viewings on videotape enabled me to more clearly pinpoint the film's flaws - poor pacing and a reliance upon special effects over character development. The sterile atmosphere of the new Starship Enterprise had seemingly seeped into the movie's tone, which was cool and unfriendly.

Now, more that 20 years later, Robert Wise has had the opportunity to return to the film and complete it in the manner he had originally envisioned. In addition to re-editing the movie, he was given the money to complete several effects sequences. The soundtrack was re-mixed and the picture was cleaned-up. The resultant product was released on DVD after consideration of a theatrical re-release was nixed. (A friend of mine who works for Paramount indicated that, had there been an actor's strike, Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director's Edition would have been in multiplexes some time during 2002, but, since the strike didn't happen, tentative plans for a theatrical launch were scrapped.)

The film's total running length has hardly changed, expanding by four minutes from 2:12 to 2:16. However, alterations to the Director's Edition represent more than just adding a few scenes. Some material was either removed or replaced (all of the deleted scenes and trims are available as part of the DVD's supplementary material). In total, about 10% of the film is different from the theatrical cut, but the changes, while seemingly slight, result in a significantly improved motion picture. Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director's Edition is no 2001 (its obvious inspiration - a fact that is more evident here than ever before), but it represents thought-provoking, well constructed science fiction.

So why is this version better than its theatrical sibling? The first, and most obvious, reason is that the pacing is better. Some of the new effects transform the V'ger trip into a more involving experience, and the inclusion of several character-based scenes that were previously edited out (Spock weeping for V'ger, Kirk ordering Scotty to prepare for a self-destruct) subtly shift the focus away from technical elements and back to the players. Wise's decisions about what to eliminate and what to add are inspired. The entire second act feels completely different. Secondly, the improved sound allows the audio to pack a punch that the original never did. And, finally, there's an intangible - because the movie explores ideas, it has aged better than many of its action-oriented contemporaries.

The ""idea"" aspect of Star Trek - The Motion Picture is enhanced in this version. The film spends more time exploring those unique qualities that make human beings special, and the importance of tempering logic and knowledge with emotion. Spock's breakthrough comes when he embraces his human half instead of rejecting it. For V'ger to grow, it must find a way to move beyond the cold machine logic of its programming. To do that, V'ger wants to ""join"" with its creator, and, in this, the film illuminates our need to strive for new goals and seek to attain the previously unattainable. And, while Star Trek - The Motion Picture doesn't answer the questions of ""Who am I? Why am I here?"", it isn't afraid to ask them.

It's interesting to note that the new special effects (produced by Foundation Imaging) - including an improved vision of Vulcan, a more impressive end to the wormhole sequence, our first view of the entire V'ger ship from the outside, and a change in the approach ""walkway"" to V'ger at the end - are done in such a manner that they blend seamlessly with the work done by Douglas Trumbell and John Dykstra 22 years ago. Nothing in Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director's Edition seems out of place. A casual viewer who hasn't seen the film in more than two decades might assume that little or nothing had changed.

Jerry Goldsmith's score, which has since become a staple in the Star Trek musical lexicon, represents one of the film's strengths. It's the music, as much as the visuals, that makes the shuttle's initial approach to the Enterprise such a majestic moment. The sequence is overlong, but the thrill of hearing Goldsmith's score allows us to enjoy the moment rather than fall asleep. The ominous, ethereal strains of his V'ger themes enhance the sense that the Enterprise is penetrating ever deeper into a wondrous and dangerous realm as it moves deeper into the aliens' vessel.

When it comes to a Star Trek movie, the quality of acting is largely irrelevant. The familiar faces are all there doing pretty much what we expect them to do. William Shatner, ever the ham, applies his unique brand of overacting to Kirk, and we welcome it. (To be fair, Shatner is capable of giving a good performance as Kirk - something he does in Star Treks II, III, and VI.) Leonard Nimoy imbues Spock with a quiet dignity and DeForest Kelley slides easily into the part of the anti-technology old country doctor. The camaraderie between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, one of the strengths of the TV series, is in evidence here, although not to the extent that it could have been. As far as the newcomers are concerned, Stephen Collins is solid as Decker. However, while Persis Khambatta is striking to look at as the svelte, bald Ilia, this is not a memorable example of acting.

Re-visiting Star Trek - The Motion Picture via this director's cut is like seeing a familiar story unfold in a new way. Wise's picture was an ambitious effort from the beginning, striving for a greatness that it never attained. In this new version, it still falls short, but not by as much. It has taken more than 20 years for Robert Wise to return to his chapter of the Star Trek saga and fulfill his vision. With no hesitation, I can say that it has been worth the wait. Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director's Edition vaults this movie from a position as one of the weakest entries in the long-running film series to a perch as one of the strongest."
10114,"THE GODFATHER, PART III","""The Godfather, Part III"" continues the Corleone family history in 1979, as the sins of the parents are visited upon the children. Despite every attempt to go legit, to become respectable, the past cannot be silenced. The family has amassed unimaginable wealth, and as the film opens Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is being invested with a great honor by the church. Later that day, at a reception, his daughter announces a Corleone family gift to the church and the charities of Sicily, ""a check in the amount of $100 million."" But the Corleones are about to find, as others have throughout history, that you cannot buy forgiveness. Sure, you can do business with evil men inside the church, for all men are fallible and capable of sin. But God does not take payoffs.
Michael is older now and walks with a stoop. He has a diabetic condition. He has spent the years since ""The Godfather, Part II"" trying to move the family out of crime and into legitimate businesses. He has turned over a lot of the old family rackets to a new generation, to people like Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who is not scrupulous about dealing dope, who is capable of making deals that would offend the fastidious Michael. It is Michael's dream, now that he senses his life is coming to a close, that he can move his family into the light.
But the past is seductive. Because Michael knows how to run a Mafia family, there is great pressure on him to do so. And throughout ""Godfather III"" we are aware of the essential tragedy of this man, the fact that the sins that stain his soul will not wash off - especially the sin of having ordered the death of his brother Fredo.
Michael is positioned in the story between two characters who could come from ""King Lear"" - his daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), whom he loves and wants to give his kingdom to, and Sonny's son, Vincent (Andy Garcia), who sees the death of his enemies as the answer to every question. Michael is torn between the futures represented by the two characters, between Mary, quiet and naive, and the hot-blooded Vincent. And when Vincent seduces Mary and makes her his own, Michael's plans begin to go wrong.
There is also Kay Corleone (Diane Keaton), of course, still the woman Michael loves, and the mother of his children. He wants their son, Anthony, to join the family business. She defends his ambition to be an opera singer. They face each other like skilled opponents.
Perhaps she even still loves him, too, or would if she did not know him so well. She is the only person who can tell Michael what she really thinks, and in one of those dark, gloomy rooms, she lets him know that it doesn't matter what grand order he is invested in by the church, he is at heart still a gangster. The best scenes in ""Godfather III"" are between these two, Michael and Kay, Pacino and Keaton, fiercely locked in a battle that began too many years ago, at that wedding feast where Michael told Kay he was not part of his family business.
The plot of the movie, concocted by Coppola and Mario Puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines, brings the Corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the Vatican. Actual events - the untimely suddenness of John Paul I's death, the scandals at the Vatican Bank, the body of a Vatican banker found hanging from a London bridge - are cheerfully intertwined with the Corleone's fictional story, and it is suggested that the Vatican lost hundreds of millions in a fraud. We eavesdrop on corrupt Vatican officials, venal cardinals scheming in the vast Renaissance palaces that dwarf them, and we travel to Sicily so that Michael Corleone can consult with Don Tommasino, his trusted old friend, to discover who is plotting against him within the Mafia council.
They are so seductive, these byzantine intrigues. Alliances are forged with a pragmatic decision, betrayed with sudden violence.
Always there is someone in a corner, whispering even more devious advice. This trait of operatic plotting and betrayal is practiced beautifully by Connie Corleone (Talia Shire), Michael's sister, who has turned in middle age into a fierce, thin-faced woman in black, who stands in the deepest shadows, who schemes and lobbies for her favorites - especially for Vincent, whom she wants Michael to accept and embrace.
In the ""Godfather"" movies Coppola has made a world. Because we know it so intimately, because its rhythms and values are instantly recognizable to us, a film like ""The Godfather Part III"" probably works better than it should. If you stand back and look at it rationally, this is a confusing and disjointed film. It is said that Coppola was rewriting it as he went along, and indeed it lacks the confident forward sweep of a film that knows where it's going.
Some of the dialogue scenes, especially in the beginning, sound vaguely awkward; the answers do not fit the questions, and conversations seem to have been rewritten in the editing room. Other shots - long shots, into the light, so we cannot see the characters' lips -- look suspiciously like scenes that were filmed first and dubbed later. The whole ambitious final movement of the film - in which two separate intrigues are intercut with the progress of an opera being sung by Anthony -- is intended to be suspenseful but is so confusing, we are not even sure which place (Sicily, Rome, London?) one of the intrigues is occurring. The final scene of the movie, which is intended to echo Marlon Brando's famous death scene, is perfunctory and awkward.
And yet it's strange how the earlier movies fill in the gaps left by this one, and answer the questions. It is, I suspect, not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two, and yet, knowing them, ""Part III"" works better than it should, evokes the same sense of wasted greatness, of misdirected genius. Both Don Vito Corleone and Don Michael Corleone could have been great men. But they lacked that final shred of character that would have allowed them to break free from their own pasts. Or perhaps their tragedies were dictated by circumstances. Perhaps they were simply born into the wrong family.
And so here we are back again, in the rich, deep brown rooms inhabited by the Corleone family, the rooms filled with shadows and memories, and regretful decisions that people may have to die. We have been taught this world so well by Francis Ford Coppola that we enter it effortlessly has there ever before been a film saga so seductive and compelling, so familiar to us that even after years we remember all of the names of the players? Here, for example, is a new character, introduced as ""Sonny's illegitimate son,"" and, yes, we nod like cousins at a family reunion, yes, he does seem a lot like Sonny.
He's the same kind of hotheaded, trigger-happy lunatic."
10115,"INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE","There is a certain style of illustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s - in those innocent publications that have been replaced by magazines on punk lifestyles and movie monsters. The illustrations were always about the same. They showed a small group of swarthy men hovering over a treasure trove with greedy grins on their bearded faces, while in the foreground, two teenage boys peered out from behind a rock in wonder and astonishment. The point of view was always over the boys' shoulders; the reader was invited to share this forbidden glimpse of the secret world of men.
“Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” begins with just such a scene; director Steven Spielberg must have been paging through his old issues of Boys' Life and Thrilling Wonder Tales, down in the basement.
As I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop.
Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines. When the swarthy men bend over their discovery, it seems to glow with a light of its own, which bathes their faces in a golden glow. This is the kind of moment that can actually justify a line like It's mine! All mine! - although Spielberg does not go so far.
One of the two kids behind the boulder is, of course, the young Indiana Jones. But he is discovered by explorers plundering an ancient treasure, and escapes just in the nick of time. The sequence ends as an adult claps a battered fedora down on Indiana's head, and then we flash forward to the era of World War II.
The opening sequence of this third Indiana Jones movie is the only one that seems truly original - or perhaps I should say, it recycles images from 1940s pulps and serials that Spielberg has not borrowed before. The rest of the movie will not come as a surprise to students of Indiana Jones, but then how could it? The Jones movies by now have defined a familiar world of death-defying stunts, virtuoso chases, dry humor and the quest for impossible goals in unthinkable places.
When “Raiders of the Lost Ark” appeared, it defined a new energy level for adventure movies; it was a delirious breakthrough. But there was no way for Spielberg to top himself, and perhaps it is just as well that “Last Crusade” will indeed be Indy's last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies.
Even in this third adventure, some of the key elements are recycled from “Raiders.” This time, Indy's quest is to find the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus Christ is said to have used at the Last Supper.
(To drink from the cup is to have eternal youth.) The Holy Grail reminds us of the Ark of the Covenant in the first film, and in both cases the chase is joined by Nazi villains.
The new element this time is how Spielberg fills in some of the past of the Jones character. We learn his real name (which I would not dream of revealing here), and we meet his father, Professor Henry Jones, who is played by Sean Connery on exactly the right note.
Like the fathers of classic boys' stories, Dr. Jones is not a parent so much as a grown-up ally, an older pal who lacks three dimensions because children are unable to see their parents in that complexity. I kept being reminded of the father in the Hardy Boys books, who shook his head and smiled at the exploits of his lovable lads and only rarely “expressed concern” or “cautioned them sternly.” Since the Hardy Boys were constantly involved, at a tender age, with an endless series of counterfeiters, car thieves, kidnap rings, Nazi spies and jewel thieves, their father's detachment seemed either saintly or mad - and Connery has fun with some of the same elements.
Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones again this time, and what he does seems so easy, so deadpan, that few other actors could maintain such a straight and credible presence in the midst of such chaos. After young Indy discovers his life's mission in the early scenes, the central story takes place years later, when Dr. Jones (the world's leading expert on the Holy Grail) is kidnapped by desperados who are convinced he knows the secret of where it is now hidden.
He does. And Indy, working from his father's notebook, follows a trail from America to the watery catacombs beneath Venice, and then to the deserts of the Holy Land, where there is a sensational chase scene involving a gigantic Nazi armored tank.
He is accompanied on his mission by Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), an art historian he meets in Venice. But the character is a disappointment after the fire of Karen Allen in the first movie, and even the sultriness of Kate Capshaw in the second.
Spielberg devises several elaborate set-pieces, of which I especially liked the rat-infested catacombs and sewers beneath Venice.
(I tried not to remember that Venice, by definition, has no catacombs.) The art direction looks great in a scene involving a zeppelin, and an escape from the airship by airplane. And the great tank in the desert is fearsome and convincing.
If there is just a shade of disappointment after seeing this movie, it has to be because we will never again have the shock of this material seeming new. “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” now more than ever, seems a turning point in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was really no way Spielberg could make it new all over again.
What he has done is to take many of the same elements, and apply all of his craft and sense of fun to make them work yet once again. And they do."
10116,"OCEAN'S TWELVE","Just as most caper movies end with the thieves comfortably basking in retirement, so most sequels to caper movies begin with the thieves forced to go back to work and pull one more job. ""Ocean's Twelve"" does not disappoint. Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) is chatting on the phone with her husband Danny (George Clooney) when she looks out the window and says, ""Oh, no."" Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is ringing the door bell.
You will recall that in ""Ocean's Eleven,"" Benedict was the owner of the Bellagio, a casino in Las Vegas from which the 11 stole -- well, let's see, with interest, it works out to about $19 million apiece. Benedict is accompanied on his visit by evil-looking twins and has a off-putting practice of poking people with a putter, the better to suggest dire consequences if his money is not returned. Yes, the insurance company has already paid off, but he envisions double indemnity.
With some movies, you begin to notice implausibilities. With others, you begin to admire them. For example, since Benedict eventually pays a personal call on each and every one of the original 11, why don't Danny and Tess simply telephone the other nine and warn them Benedict is coming? The reason you don't want to ask that question is because it would prevent the movie from introducing all the crooks and showing us what they're doing now.
One of the problems with a movie like this is directing traffic: How do you establish 11 characters (not counting Benedict, police inspector Catherine Zeta-Jones, rival thief Vincent Cassel, etc.) and keep them alive? You have a roll call every once in a while is what you do, or you have them thrown in jail so the camera can pan across their faces and remind us who they are. Occasionally you have a scene for no other reason than to get an actor's face on the screen for five seconds, so he will not be misplaced. Elliott Gould puffs on his cigar three different times for this very reason.
The movie takes inventory of its characters with the same droll wit it does everything else. The original original ""Ocean's 11,"" made in 1960 by the Rat Pack, was a send-up of 1950s caper movies (it was inspired by Jean-Pierre Melville's French classic ""Bob le Flambeur""). The new original ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) was a successful attempt by Soderbergh to doodle with the formula, much as a pianist might pick out a tune just well enough to show he could play it if he wanted to. Now, with ""Ocean's Twelve,"" Soderbergh and his scenarists, George Clayton Johnson, Jack Golden Russell and George Nolfi, are doing a jazz riff. This isn't a caper movie at all, it's an improvisation on caper themes. If at times it seems like a caper, well, as the fellow said when he got up from the piano, it might not be Beethoven, but it has a lot of the same notes.
What Soderbergh is working with here is the charm of his actors, particularly Clooney, Roberts, Brad Pitt and Jones, who have the key roles, and the puppy-dog earnestness of Matt Damon, who wakes up Pitt on a trans-Atlantic flight to tell him he thinks he's ready to play ""a more central role."" Damon's character is named Linus, a good choice, since he is too sincere and intense to rise in Ocean's ironic universe. When one character is excoriated as agoraphobic (what a wonderful phrase that is, ""excoriated as agoraphobic,"" don't you think it's almost musical?), Linus earnestly argues, ""I don't think we have to be the kind of organization that labels people."" There is a scene of mad invention in which Clooney and Pitt take him along for a meeting with Robbie Coltrane, an underworld contact, and their entire conversation is nonsense -- an exchange of elegantly meaningless paradoxes. Linus doesn't understand a word, which is reasonable, but what he doesn't realize is that they don't, either.
Their scheme has to do with stealing enough stuff to pay Benedict the $19 million apiece that they owe him. They doubt they can raise this much money in the two weeks until their deadline, especially since it appears that another thief, the Night Fox, is in business against them, and is either more skilled than they are, or a supernatural being. As they contemplate the security surrounding one of their targets, Pitt flatly states: ""In the physical universe we live in, it cannot be done."" But the Night Fox can do it.
Occasionally their plans take the long way around. Consider a man in Amsterdam who has sealed himself and his treasures inside a house guarded with multiple alarm systems and never leaves home. Surveillance indicates there is a control pad on an inner wall which might be manipulated to bypass the alarms. How to reach it? Their plan involves getting underneath the house, which is beside a canal and rests on underwater pylons, and using hydraulic lifts to raise the house one inch, so that a difficult shot with an arrow becomes possible. Uh, huh. With overhead like that, when do they reach their break-even point?
Rather than describe some of their other targets, such as a priceless jeweled egg, I will observe that all of the targets are MacGuffins, that it matters not what they go after but how they do it, and what they say in the process. The movie is all about behavior, dialogue, star power and wiseass in-jokes. I really sort of liked it.
Example of the cleverness: There are two cameos in the movie that, for once, contribute something more than allowing us to say, ""Hey! There's (name of star)!"" The genius is that one of the stars is really there, and the other star is not really there, although she is there in the person of the character who seems to be her. This will all become clear when you see the movie. What I liked is that the one cameo role is used to expose the other cameo role. When you get to the point of interlocking cameos, you have ascended to a level of invention that is its own reward."
10117,Gladiator,"Gladiator is the kind of movie upon which Hollywood once built its reputation but rarely produces anymore: the spectacle. Filled with larger-than-life characters, gorgeous scenery, impressive set design, and epic storytelling, Gladiator is designed not just to entertain, but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. A boisterous reaction is expected every time the protagonist defies the odds and wins a conflict, or changes the tide of battle in his favor. This is filmmaking on a grand scale.

Director Ridley Scott made his name in movies by helming two acknowledged science fiction classics: Alien and Blade Runner. Aside from those films, however, his resume is littered with mediocre and unpromising titles, such as his most recent outing, G.I. Jane. (Some argue that Scott returned to form with 1991's overrated Thelma and Louise, but that's not an opinion I share.) Gladiator represents the British-born filmmaker's second attempt at an historical epic, and is far more successful than his previous endeavor, the stultifying 1492: Conquest of Paradise, which recounted Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World.

Gladiator is set in 180 AD, and uses actual historical personages and events for background. The events that transpire in the film are largely fictional, but they blend in well with the known facts. The Roman Empire is in full blossom, having survived the excesses of one corrupt emperor after the next. The latest Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a scholar who has taken to the battlefield to repel a barbarian threat from Germania. To that end, he has invaded, relying upon the leadership and valor of his best general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), to win the day. Maximus does not disappoint, and the Emperor privately decides to name him a his successor - a decision that does not sit well with Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus' son. In a fit of rage and grief, he kills his father, then has Maximus taken away to be executed. The general, however, escapes death, slaying his would-be killers, then races home to protect his wife and son. But he is too late - by the time he arrives, they are both dead, and he is soon taken prisoner by slave-traders. Along with his new friend Juba (Djimon Hounsou), he is bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed), an owner and trainer of Gladiators. Recognizing Maximus' potential, Proximo grooms him for a trip to Rome's Coliseum.

Gladiator weds the heroic scope of movies like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Braveheart, and Rob Roy with the serpentine political treachery of I, Claudius. (A connection that is italicized by the presence of Claudius lead, Derek Jacobi, in the supporting role of a Roman Senator.) The film never fails to be involving and entertaining, and there are plenty of moments designed to stir the adrenaline. Additionally, the screenplay manages to avoid the trap of predictability. The villains are at least as smart as the heroes, and far more ruthless.

For New Zealand-born, Australian-bred actor Russell Crowe, Gladiator represents an opportunity to expand his reputation, which was heightened earlier this year by a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand in Michael Mann's The Insider. This is Crowe's first opportunity to carry a big-budget motion picture. The role of Maximus requires more presence than acting skill, and Crowe proves equal to the task. From films as diverse as Proof, Romper Stomper, and The Insider, we know he can act. Gladiator shows that he can dominate the screen with a cold stare, a clenched jaw, and a sure gait - attributes normally reserved for the likes of action mega-stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.

The supporting cast is comprised primarily of European notables. The exception is Joaquin Phoenix, whose Commodus is a conflicted-yet-detestable villain. Phoenix plays the character as a spoiled degenerate with effeminate mannerisms and huge appetites (historians mark the real Commodus as one of Rome's worst emperors). Yet, like a snake coiled and ready to strike, he is both unpredictable and dangerous. Connie Nielsen (who was one of the astronauts in Mission to Mars) is Commodus' sister, who was once Maximus' lover and whose 8-year old son is the current heir to Caesar's throne. Veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (in the final performance of a long career) all have significant screen time. And Djimon Hounsou, whose breakout role was as the lead in Amistad, plays Maximus' brother-in-captivity.

Perhaps Scott's greatest achievement with Gladiator is neither keeping the pacing of a 2 1/2 hour movie tight nor choreographing a spectacular battle scene, but creating a second-century Rome that is entirely credible and stunning in its detail. Ancient Rome is one of the most romanticized civilizations in the history of humanity, and rarely has it been brought to life with the grandeur of this film. The Coliseum, for example, has been resurrected to its full glory (largely through the use of digital technology). Gladiator consistently looks good, although, during some of the fights, rapid cutting creates a sense of disorientation and confusion.

One minor stumbling block for the film is an occasional tendency towards moments of pretension. One of Gladiator's themes is that power comes through controlling the mob. Successful gladiators are those who not only sate the crowd's desire for blood, but do so in an entertaining fashion. From time-to-time, a character will make a florid, preachy speech about this (or some other issue). We get snippets of dialogue like ""The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it's the sand of the Coliseum."" (Delivered by Jacobi, the line sounds positively Shakespearean.) There's nothing wrong with injecting social commentary about the bestial nature of human beings into a movie like Gladiator - my argument is that it should be more subtle. But that's a minor quibble.

Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. In this case, he is a slave taking on the most powerful man in the world - the Emperor of Rome. The ending may be a unlikely (although, from Commodus' point-of-view, it could be a shrewd move if handled properly), but it is as exhilarating and satisfying as the final confrontation between Liam Neeson and Tim Roth in Rob Roy. As spectacles go, Gladiator has a great deal to recommend it. And, while the film has the ingredients to win over most audiences, it remains to be seen whether the marketing campaign and positive word-of-mouth will generate enough ticket sales for this cinematic combatant to remain strong when the field of early summer challengers becomes more difficult.

"
10118,GLADIATOR,"Maximus: I'm required to kill--so I kill. That's enough.
Proximo: That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.
A foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They're bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero's dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is ""Rocky"" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for ""convenient"" and not what you're thinking).
After escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father's ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.
This same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But ""Gladiator"" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.
Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with ""Spartacus"" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov's great Nero in ""Quo Vadis"" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.
The moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city's Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor's popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.
The Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, ""My history's a little hazy--but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?"" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: ""Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!"" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in ""Rob Roy"" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.
When Maximus wins his first big fight, it's up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. ""Live! Live!"" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a ""thumbs up."" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.
Crowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in ""Amistad."" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.
Nielsen shows the film's most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.
""Gladiator"" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur."" This is more like ""Spartacus Lite."" Or dark. It's only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor's ""Titus,"" for a film set in ancient Rome that's immeasurably better to look at. The visual accomplishment of ""Titus"" shames ""Gladiator,"" and its story is a whole heck of a lot better than the ""Gladiator"" screenplay, even if Shakespeare didn't make his Titus the only undefeated champion in Roman history."
10119,"Ocean's Twelve","Pleasantness and affability reign supreme in Steven Soderbergh's sequel to the remake of Ocean's Eleven. This time around, even the bad guys don't seem so bad. Rumor has it that the atmosphere on the set of Ocean's Twelve was so easy-going that it was more like summer camp than a movie shoot, and much of the sense of fun comes across on screen. Everyone who survived the first film is back for the second, including the entire complement of ""Ocean's Eleven."" There are two high-profile newcomers. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Europol agent Isabel Lahiri, an ex-flame of Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who is the confidante of Danny Ocean (George Clooney). The there's Vincent Cassel, who portrays ""The Night Fox,"" a rival thief who believes that Ocean's reputation is inflated - a fact he intends to prove by challenging his rival to a thieving competition.

When the film opens, Danny is retired and living in marital bliss with his wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). It's their ""second third"" anniversary, and Danny's life is about to go to hell. Someone has tipped off Casino honcho Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) about the location of Danny and his ten friends, and they all receive an ultimatum: pay back $160 million (plus interest) in two weeks or face the consequences. So it's off to Europe for Ocean's Eleven (they're too notorious to be able to pull any heists stateside), where they have to steal enough money in 12 days to be able to fulfill their obligation to Benedict.

Despite being overlong (does any caper comedy need to eat up more than two hours?), Ocean's Twelve is enjoyable, and will likely appeal to anyone who appreciated the 2001 film. Not only are the actors the same, but the men behind the scenes, including Soderbergh, producer Jerry Weintraub, and composer David Holmes, have returned for another round. The screenplay, by George Nolfi, starts out a little slow, but, by the end of the first hour, it has hit its stride with the movie building momentum. The complicated details of the final heist are entertaining to unravel, and there's also a wonderfully wry bit of fourth wall-breaking fun that Soderbergh has at Julia Roberts' expense. Some might consider this to be too cute, but, from my perspective, it's ballsy.

With a cast of this size, it's expected that some of the performers will be featured far more than others. This time around, Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner have the least screen time. The latter spends most of the time out of the game while the former cools his heels in prison for two-thirds of the film. While there's plenty of opportunity for Roberts, Clooney, and Matt Damon to say lines and interact, the real ""star"" (if there can be said to be one) is Brad Pitt. There's a fair amount of smoldering chemistry between Rusty and Isabel, which is as much due to Zeta-Jones as to Pitt. Despite being new to this series, Isabel has the fullest ""character moments"" of any of the baker's dozen.

Although it functions adequately as a heist movie, Ocean's Twelve fairs better when seen through the lens of a comedy. The screenplay offers a lot of breezy dialogue, and, while it never gets overly silly, it's clear that we're not meant to take any of the proceedings seriously. (The business with Julia Roberts makes that abundantly clear.) There is a ""surprise"" cameo at the end, although astute viewers can figure out long before the moment of the ""big reveal"" whom Soderbergh's veteran player is (I'm not talking about Bruce Willis). And, as must always be the case with any movie involving planned criminal activities, there are plenty of twists, including the expected final one.

If there's a difference between Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve, it's the involvement of Mr. Murphy. In the first film, not all that much went wrong. This time around, however, Murphy's Law strikes with a vengeance. Danny and his friends get to learn first hand the truth in the saying, ""The best laid plans of mice and men..."" In the end, however, it will come as no big surprise to learn that everything isn't as straightforward as it initially appears.

Soderbergh peppers the print with occasional directorial flourishes (freeze-frames, the use of colored filters, etc.), but, for the most part, he presents the film ""straight."" And, on those occasions when he shows off, it's neither prolonged nor extreme enough to become distracting. One could make an argument that the filmmaker isn't so much directing his actors as he is shepherding them through the movie-making process. There's a sense that at least some of the dialogue was improvised. The final result speaks well for the process, whatever it actually was. Ocean's Twelve represents a lively way to spend a December evening."
10120,"SPIRITED AWAY","""Miyazaki's Spirited Away"" has been compared to ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and indeed it tells of a 10-year-old girl who wanders into a world of strange creatures and illogical rules. But it's enchanting and delightful in its own way, and has a good heart. It is the best animated film of recent years, the latest work by Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese master who is a god to the Disney animators.
Because many adults have an irrational reluctance to see an animated film from Japan (or anywhere else), I begin with reassurances: It has been flawlessly dubbed into English by John Lasseter (""Toy Story""), it was co-winner of this year's Berlin Film Festival against ""regular"" movies, it passed ""Titanic"" to become the top-grossing film in Japanese history, and it is the first film ever to make more than $200 million before opening in America.
I feel like I'm giving a pitch on an infomercial, but I make these points because I come bearing news: This is a wonderful film. Don't avoid it because of what you think you know about animation from Japan. And if you only go to Disney animation--well, this is being released by Disney.
Miyazaki's works (""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Princess Mononoke"") have a depth and complexity often missing in American animation. Not fond of computers, he draws thousand of frames himself, and there is a painterly richness in his work. He's famous for throwaway details at the edges of the screen (animation is so painstaking that few animators draw more than is necessary). And he permits himself silences and contemplation, providing punctuation for the exuberant action and the lovable or sometimes grotesque characters.
""Spirited Away"" is told through the eyes of Chihiro (voice by Daveigh Chase), a 10-year-old girl, and is more personal, less epic, than ""Princess Mononoke."" As the story opens, she's on a trip with her parents, and her father unwisely takes the family to explore a mysterious tunnel in the woods. On the other side is what he speculates is an old theme park; but the food stalls still seem to be functioning, and as Chihiro's parents settle down for a free meal, she wanders away and comes upon the film's version of wonderland, which is a towering bathhouse.
A boy named Haku appears as her guide, and warns her that the sorceress who runs the bathhouse, named Yubaba, will try to steal her name and thus her identity. Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette) is an old crone with a huge face; she looks a little like a Toby mug, and dotes on a grotesquely huge baby named Boh. Ominously, she renames Chihiro, who wanders through the structure, which is populated, like ""Totoro,"" with little balls of dust that scurry and scamper underfoot.
In the innards of the structure, Chihiro comes upon the boiler room, operated by a man named Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers), who is dressed in a formal coat and has eight limbs, which he employs in a bewildering variety of ways. At first he seems as fearsome as the world he occupies, but he has a good side, is no friend of Yubaba, and perceives Chihiro's goodness.
If Yubaba is the scariest of the characters and Kamaji the most intriguing, Okutaresama is the one with the most urgent message. He is the spirit of the river, and his body has absorbed the junk, waste and sludge that has been thrown into it over the years. At one point, he actually yields up a discarded bicycle. I was reminded of a throwaway detail in ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" where a child looks into a bubbling brook, and there is a discarded bottle at the bottom. No point is made; none needs to be made.
Japanese myths often use shape-shifting, in which bodies reveal themselves as facades concealing a deeper reality. It's as if animation was invented for shape-shifting, and Miyazaki does wondrous things with the characters here. Most alarming for Chihiro, she finds that her parents have turned into pigs after gobbling up the free lunch. Okutaresama reveals its true nature after being freed of decades of sludge and discarded household items. Haku is much more than he seems. Indeed the entire bathhouse seems to be under spells affected the appearance and nature of its inhabitants.
Miyazaki's drawing style, which descends from the classical Japanese graphic artists, is a pleasure to regard, with its subtle use of colors, clear lines, rich detail and its realistic depiction of fantastical elements. He suggests not just the appearances of his characters, but their natures. Apart from the stories and dialogue, ""Spirited Away"" is a pleasure to regard just for itself. This is one of the year's best films.
"
10121,"LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS","With ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien.
The task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. ""The Two Towers"" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there.
""The Two Towers"" is a rousing adventure, a skillful marriage of special effects and computer animation, and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty. It also gives us, in a character named the Gollum, one of the most engaging and convincing CGI creatures I've seen. The Gollum was long in possession of the Ring, now entrusted to Frodo, and misses it (""my precious"") most painfully; but he has a split personality and (in between spells when his dark side takes over) serves as a guide and companion for Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin). His body language is a choreography of ingratiation and distortion.
The film introduces another computer-generated character, Treebeard, a member of the most ancient race in Middle-Earth, a tree that walks and talks and takes a very long time to make up its mind, explaining to Merry and Pippin that slowness is a virtue. I would have guessed that a walking, talking tree would look silly and break the spell of the movie, but no, there is a certain majesty in this mossy old creature.
The film opens with a brief reprise of the great battle between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Balrog, the monster made of fire and smoke, and is faithful to the ancient tradition of movie serials by showing us that victory is snatched from certain death, as Gandalf extinguishes the creature and becomes in the process Gandalf the White.
To compress the labyrinthine story into a sentence or two, the enemy is Saruman (Christopher Lee), who commands a vast army of Uruk-Hai warriors against the fortress of Theoden (Bernard Hill). Aragorn joins bravely in the fray, but the real heroes are the computer effects, which create the castle, landscape, armies and most of the action.
There are long stretches of ""The Two Towers"" in which we are looking at mostly animation on the screen. When Aragorn and his comrades launch an attack down a narrow fortress bridge, we know that the figures toppling to their doom are computer-generated, along with everything else on the screen, and yet the impact of the action is undeniable. Peter Jackson, like some of the great silent directors, is unafraid to use his entire screen, to present images of wide scope and great complexity. He paints in the corners.
What one misses in the thrills of these epic splendors is much depth in the characters. All of the major figures are sketched with an attribute or two, and then defined by their actions. Frodo, the nominal hero, spends much of his time peering over and around things, watching others decide his fate, and occasionally gazing significantly upon the Ring. Sam is his loyal sidekick on the sidelines. Merry and Pippin spend a climactic stretch of the movie riding in Treebeard's branches and looking goggle-eyed at everything, like children carried on their father's shoulders. The fellowship of the first movie has been divided into three during this one, and most of the action centers on Aragorn, who operates within the tradition of Viking swordsmen and medieval knights.
The details of the story--who is who, and why, and what their histories and attributes are--still remains somewhat murky to me. I know the general outlines and I boned up by rewatching the first film on DVD the night before seeing the second, and yet I am in awe of the true students of the Ring. For the amateur viewer, which is to say for most of us, the appeal of the movies is in the visuals. Here there be vast caverns and mighty towers, dwarves and elves and Orcs and the aforementioned Uruk-Hai (who look like distant cousins of the aliens in ""Battlefield Earth""). And all are set within Jackson's ambitious canvas and backdropped by spectacular New Zealand scenery.
""The Two Towers"" will possibly be more popular than the first film, more of an audience-pleaser, but hasn't Jackson lost the original purpose of the story somewhere along the way? He has taken an enchanting and unique work of literature and retold it in the terms of the modern action picture. If Tolkien had wanted to write about a race of supermen, he would have written a Middle-Earth version of ""Conan the Barbarian."" But no. He told a tale in which modest little hobbits were the heroes. And now Jackson has steered the story into the action mainstream. To do what he has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver."
10122,"Pirates of the Caribbean': Eat My Jetsam, Davy Jon","AT first glance, it seems like a pretty good deal. You put down your money — still less than $10 in most cities — and in return you get two and a half hours of spirited swashbuckling, with an all-star three-way battle of the cheekbones (Orlando Bloom vs. Keira Knightley vs. Johnny Depp) and some extra-slimy computer-generated imagery thrown in at no additional cost. But there's a catch, as there usually is. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is not just a movie. It's a glistening, sushi-grade chunk of franchise entertainment, which means that maximal enjoyment of it comes with certain obligations. It is the second episode in what will be at least a trilogy — the third installment is scheduled for release next summer — and full appreciation of its whirligig plot will depend on thorough acquaintance with the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" picture, conveniently available for purchase on DVD. And since ""Dead Man's Chest"" brazenly dispenses with the convention of an ending — it's pretty much all middle — you will, by virtue of buying that ticket, have committed yourself to buying another one a year from now if you're the least bit curious about how the whole thing turns out. By then, chances are good that you will have forgotten most of what happened in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so you'll have another disc to add to the shopping cart.  The question is: Is it worth it? The same thought probably crosses the minds of Disney theme-park vacationers as they endure endless lines for the ride on which the movies are based, but the notion is quickly banished because nobody likes to feel like a sucker. By a rational calculation of time and money — yours and the untold millions invested by Disney, the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and others — the answer is probably no. But hey, this isn't about that, right? It's about fun. You're there to have fun. Fun for the family. Fun for the kids. Fun for everyone. So shut up and have fun.  And you probably will, even if it's hard to shake the feeling that you've been bullied into it. Gore Verbinski, the director, has an appropriate sense of mischief, as a well as a gift, nearly equaling those of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, for integrating CGI seamlessly into his cinematic compositions. What is curious about the recent crop of high-tech blockbusters is how seriously they take themselves, and unlike, say, ""Superman Returns,"" ""Dead Man's Chest"" cannot be called pretentious. It makes no claims to being about good and evil, the difficulty of saving the world in the modern era, or the inner lives of any of its characters.  Instead, it sends Elizabeth Swann (Ms. Knightley) and Will Turner (Mr. Bloom), their wedding day ruined in an opening sequence that seems to pay tribute to the old Guns N' Roses ""November Rain"" video, on a search for the pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Mr. Depp). Jack, as usual, finds himself in all kinds of trouble, pursued not only by agents of the British crown, but also by an undead, squid-faced mariner, the famous Davy Jones, who commands a ghoulish crew of half-human, half-aquatic creatures. These sailors are like the cast of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" — or the menu at a seafood restaurant —come to life: Night of the Living Bouillabaisse.  One of them, played by Stellan Skarsgard with a starfish embedded in his face, is Will's long-lost father, a development that adds a gelatinous morsel of father-son pathos to the stew of plots and subplots cooked up by the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Davy Jones himself, meanwhile, speaks in the sinister whisper of Bill Nighy, though it is his swaying mass of facial tentacles that most viewers will remember.  And there are other memorable bits and pieces, visual highlights of a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. Ms. Knightley is, once again, a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end. Mr. Bloom, as is his custom, leaps about, trying to overcome his incurable blandness, and is upstaged by special effects, musical cues, octopus tentacles and pieces of wood. Naomie Harris turns up for a few scenes of hammy voodoo, and Mackenzie Crook and David Bailie contribute some proletarian slapstick. Most of the other members of the first movie's cast show up again, sometimes in surprising circumstances.  The franchise, of course, belongs to Jack Sparrow, and to Mr. Depp. Because this is a sequel, the role is no longer the splendid surprise it was in 2003, when ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" charmed audiences and disarmed critics on its way to the third-best domestic box-office gross of the year. But the best parts of ""Dead Man's Chest"" confirm Jack Sparrow as the most viable Disney cartoon character in quite some time, though his anarchic insouciance has more in common with the work of Chuck Jones or Tex Avery. Mr. Verbinski, for his part, grasps the kinship between today's computer-assisted filmmaking and the hand-drawn animation of old, which lies in the freedom to revise the laws of physics at will. Two sequences in particular stand out, and would stand alone nicely as shorts: I will always think of them as ""Fruit Kebab"" and ""Runaway Hamster Wheel.""  But the easy delight that such flights of visual fancy inspires is crowded and blocked by all the other stuff going on in this long, ungainly movie, which for all its busy, buzzing parts, is incapable of standing on its own. It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over. By next summer, I suppose, we'll all be rested and ready for more."
10123,"Star Trek the Motion Picture (1979)
The Screen: 'S","""Star Trek,"" the popular television series that died 10 years ago but would not be forgotten, has, like Lazarus, come back to haunt the skeptical and reassure all those who have kept the faith. It's called ""Star Trek — the Motion Picture,"" rather superfluously, I think, because I doubt anyone who sees it could possibly confuse this film with those shards of an earlier, simpler, cheaper television era.

Watching ""Star Trek — the Motion Picture,"" which opens today at Loews Orpheum and other theaters, is like attending your high-school class's 10th reunion at Caesar's Palace. Most of the faces are familiar, but the décor has little relationship to anything you've ever seen before. Among the friends are good old Captain Kirk (William Shatner), commanding officer of the Starship Enterprise; pointy-eared Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), whose humanity disqualifies him from attaining ""kolinahr,"" the state of grace on his native planet Vulcan; Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), the spaceship's general practitioner, nicknamed ""Bones,"" just as he might have been on H.M.S. Bounty, and such other reliables as Scotty (James Doohan), the engineering officer, and Sulu (George Takei), the ship's helmsman.

The newcomers are Stephen Collins, who plays Commander Decker, the Enterprise's stalwart young executive officer, and Perris Khambatta, an actress from India who plays Ilia, a shockingly beautiful young woman whose head has been shaved as clean as a whistle in the fashion of her home-planet, Delta Four.

This time out the mission of the Enterprise is to intercept a mysterious cloud, which is apparently light years in diameter and is heading toward earth for reasons that not even Mr. Spock can divine. It's not revealing a secret to tell you that the cloud contains what is usually referred to under such circumstances as ""a superior intelligence,"" though just what that intelligence is must remain one of the film's few witty surprises.

I suspect that wit is not what ""Star Trek"" fans are looking for. Instead they want to see favorite characters who are as ageless and multidimensional as characters in a comic strip, and not at all ashamed of those origins. The dialogue — at least what dialogue one can hear over Jerry Goldsmith's music and the sounds of rockets being fired — is of a banality that soothes the weary mind, like Magic Fingers that work on a tired brain. Unlike ""Star Wars,"" which was full of conscious associations to other literature, ""Star Trek"" refers only to itself, with the possible exception of the climactic sequence that borrows freely from Christian myth.

The film's vision of the future, which is a bit tacky at the beginning, becomes increasingly hypnotic as the movie goes on, or maybe it just seems that way as one falls under the spell of so many abstract patterns of light and color, designed to simulate the experiences of the members of the Enterprise crew as they pass through various dimensions of time and space.

""Star Trek"" is yet another film that owes more to Douglas Trumbull and John Dykstra, who did the special photographic effects, and to Harold Michelson, the production designer, than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer, Gene Roddenberry, who also created and produced the television series.

The formidable Robert Wise, who once directed a good, pacifist sci-fi film, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951), a film with very few special effects, directed ""Star Trek,"" but I can't imagine what there was for him to do after telling the actors where to stand. Because most of the drama in such a movie is created in the laboratories, the actors are limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief.

"
10124,GODFATHER,"I remember watching one of those cable TV documentaries a few years back about gangsters and the narrator remarking that by the early seventies real-life Mafiosi had lost touch with any sense of pride in their dubious heritage. Then ""The Godfather"" came along, and many of the younger crowd of hoods began imitating what they saw on the screen. You don't think the ""Dapper Don"" just happened, do you? The clothing, the style, even some of the talk was copied from the movie. Art imitating life and, in return, life imitating art. The circle goes round and round.

Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic, ""The Godfather,"" is to gangster films what Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" is to super spectaculars. It's among the grandest of the lot in scope and vision, a film eclipsed in this regard only by Coppola's own 1974 sequel, ""The Godfather, Part II."" Yet ""The Godfather"" tells a uniquely personal story that places it in a league of its own. It's no wonder, then, that the American Film Institute voted it their third best American film in history or that it is sometimes even considered THE best, as ""Entertainment Weekly"" praised it in their book, ""The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time."" It would be over a dozen years before Coppola attempted a third installment in the series with 1990's ""The Godfather, Part III,"" which didn't quite live up to expectations but turned out to be a pretty good movie, anyway. Why the ""Godfather"" films (or ""Citizen Kane"" for that matter) had to wait so long to see the light of silver disc is anybody's guess, but here they are, ""Godfathers I, II, and III,"" looking better than we've ever seen them before in the home, packaged together in a grand, five-disc boxed set that also includes a whole mob of extra materials. ""The Godfather Collection"" is a little pricey, but it's required viewing for motion-picture buffs, gangster-movie buffs, home-theater buffs, and just about anybody else who values good filmmaking.

""The Godfather,"" as you know, actually chronicles the life and times of two fictional godfathers of crime, Don Vito (Marlon Brando), the old man and patriarch of the Corleone family, and his son Michael (Al Pacino), who eventually inherits the mantle of Boss. Based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo, the story begins in 1945, at the close of the Second World War, at the wedding of the old Don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Coppola has a wonderful eye for detail, and the wedding reception is as good an introduction as any to the big Sicilian family that would dominate all three ""Godfather"" films. But it's when Coppola takes us into the Corleone home during the festivities that we get to see what's really up; the family may be in the midst of celebration, but business goes on as usual as supplicants come to do homage to the powerful Don and ask favors of him. We're also introduced here to son Michael, a returning War hero; his fiancee, Kay (Diane Keaton); his older, stormier brother, Sonny (James Caan); and his other, weaker brother, Fredo (John Cazale); along with family associates Clemenza (Richard Castellano), Tessio (Abe Vigoda), Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). Plus, we meet Al Martino as pop singer Johnny Fontaine (supposedly patterned after Frank Sinatra) and Richard Conte as a powerful rival, Don Barzini. Later, we meet Sterling Hayden as a crooked cop named McCluskey; John Marley as a Hollywood mogul, Jack Woltz; and Al Lettieri as a ruthless henchman, Sollozzo.

Interestingly, it's been said that in order for the first ""Godfather"" film to be made in New York, Coppola had to agree not to use the words ""Mafia"" or ""Cosa Nostra"" anywhere in it. Otherwise, there may have been some interference with the production by the New York ""families."" Apparently, the mob liked what they eventually saw. Coppola initially wanted Sir Laurence Olivier to play Don Vito Corleone, but novelist Puzo wanted Brando, and Brando won out, thanks to his own eager desire to play the role and despite Paramount's less-than-enthusiastic appraisal of the idea. Brando later said he tried to imitate gangster Frank Costello's voice in the movie, but he had to redub some of his dialogue because it was so hard to understand. The film eventually won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Screenplay Adaptation.

Thanks to the enormous success of ""The Godfather,"" Paramount gave Coppola more money and a freer hand in directing the sequel, ""The Godfather, Part II."" Using a broader canvas, Coppola provides not one but two stories in the longest of the three ""Godfather"" movies. Not only do we get to see Michael's consolidation of strength as new head of the Mob family, we get to see how it all started in flashbacks to a young Vito Corleone's rise from poverty to power during the early part of the twentieth century. For me, these are the best parts of the picture, providing an epic landscape of events and an exquisite tapestry of characterizations.

Everyone assumed Brando would again star in the sequel, but he said he had done the first film as a social comment on American corporate power and had no interest in doing another. The fact that Paramount still didn't want much to do with the tempestuous Brando probably added to his turning down the role. So, Coppola worked around him, filming the few scenes in which the older Don Corleone is supposed to be present with the Don out of the room! Fortunately, the rest of the cast was to shine with even greater brilliance. Actor's Studio director and ""method"" advocate Lee Strasberg made his screen debut as Hyman Roth, the money man of the mob families, a part patterned on real-life gangster Meyer Lansky. And, of course, Robert De Niro was tapped to play the younger Don Vito, a milestone in the actor's career. This second film garnered twice the Academy Awards of its predecessor, again for Best Picture, and this time also for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (De Niro), Best Screenplay, Best Score, and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration. By the way, if the Corleone estate at Lake Tahoe looks impressive, it should be; it was the property of former industrialist Henry J. Kaiser.

By the time ""The Godfather, Part III"" was released in 1990, public interest in gangster films was beginning to wane. In any case, the movie fell short of its progenitors in critical appraisal and box-office receipts. Reviews of the day tended to point fingers at Coppola's decision to cast his own daughter, Sofia, in the major role of the Pacino character's daughter. Ms. Coppola had done little or no acting in films previously and was thought by many critics to detract from the overall high standards of the production. Frankly, I don't think many people among the general public even noticed her lack of theatrical experience, and, in fact, she carries off her part with a sweet naiveté that is fully in accord with her film character. No, I rather suspect that the third film's lackluster performance can be attributed more to the fact that it's overly complicated and hard to follow and that most of the Corleone family we had come to know (and dare I say ""love""?) had been killed off or disappeared by this time. After all, Brando was gone and De Niro and Robert Duvall and James Caan and Richard Castellano. Only Pacino, Shire, and Keaton were still in evidence, looking much older and more careworn than in the earlier pictures. Nevertheless, the introduction of Sonny's hotheaded son, Vincent (Andy Garcia), is inspired, and the movie has a polished grandeur about it that's hard to deny, especially in the famous closing moments during Coppola's poetic intercuts between opera hall and murder plot. ""The Godfather, Part III"" was nominated for seven Academy Awards but won none. The nominations were for Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Andy Garcia), Cinematography (Gordon Willis), Song (Carmine Coppola, music, and John Bettis, lyrics), Art Direction, and Film Editing.

Video:
Paramount released all three films theatrically in a 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, reproduced here in anamorphic widescreen. The colors, predominantly brown earth hues, burnished golds, and shadowy blacks and tans, are naturally reproduced, if a bit on the soft side. However, since this is the way I remember the images looking on the motion-picture screen, I'd guess the DVD transfers are probably fairly accurate, although time seems to have faded the colors somewhat and added a touch of noise. ""The Godfather, Part II,"" the longest of the movies, is spread out over two discs for maximum picture and sound quality, but the first ""Godfather"" film, surprisingly, seemed to me to have the sharpest definition and clarity of the lot; maybe I was just imagining things. I noticed some moiré effects in all three films and some moments of moderate grain and noise, the latter again perhaps due to the effects of time.

Audio:
The present Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mixes for the three films are a varied batch, spanning as they do nearly a twenty-year period. All of them convey smooth, natural voice properties and a reasonably wide dynamic range that render dialogue and effects realistically. However, they differ considerably in their ability to convey front and rear-channel information, the first of the films having an especially constricted stereo spread and very little surround sound. This should not come as a surprise. Although multi-channel stereo had been around in movies since the fifties (discounting ""Fantasia""), stereo was not widely utilized theatrically for many years thereafter, with many filmmakers either ignoring stereo or limiting its use, as was the case with the first ""Godfather"" entry. But by ""Godfather, Part II"" the sound opens up a bit more, Nino Rota's musical score in particular, and by the final installment in the series the sound appears even wider, more dynamic, and more ambient. The 5.1 remixes do their job.

Extras:
As for added-value items, there's a gang of them. Probably of most importance are the audio commentaries on each of the films by director Francis Ford Coppola. I liked the fact that he notices mistakes in the filming and isn't shy or embarrassed about pointing them out to the viewer, like, for example, the extras who were out of place in certain shots. But as he says, if audiences didn't notice or didn't care, neither did he. He provides a wealth of such details, even remarking on his battle with Paramount over the inclusion of Rota's famous music. Seems Paramount didn't like it, and Coppola did. The director threatened to risk being fired if he didn't get his way. He got his way. 

Next, there's a fifth, bonus disc in the box, which is neatly indexed for subject matter. The first item of interest on it is a seventy-three minute documentary called ""The Godfather Family: A Look Inside"" that takes us behind the scenes. It's comprised of interviews and clips from around 1970 through 1991. It's a genuinely informative work of filmmaking and not a mere fluff piece. Coppola calls ""The Godfather"" the ""biggest home movie in history."" This is accompanied by a recent seven-minute featurette, ""On Location,"" detailing the locales of the first two films. Then, there are an amazing thirty-four additional scenes that had to be cut from the movies, each with its own introduction and each following a timeline in sequence. Some of the deleted material is in widescreen, some in full-frame, all of it is fascinating. In addition, the bonus disc brings us footage of the various Academy Award acceptance speeches for the films; Francis Coppola's notebook, a ten-minute narration; and a valuable Corleone family tree to help us keep track of all the characters in the movies. Finally, there are segments on Gordon Willis's cinematography, Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's music, Coppola and Mario Puzo's screenplays, plus the usual assortment of storyboards, photo galleries, and theatrical trailers for each of the three films. 

""The Godfather"" is accompanied by twenty-three scene selections; ""Part II"" by thirty scene selections; and ""Part III"" by twenty-five scene selections. Oh, and click around on the various menus for ""extra"" extras not mentioned. English and French are available for spoken languages, with English subtitles an option for the hearing impaired. The way I figure it, if you watch each of the three films one time through, it will take you something over nine hours. If you watch them a second time through with Coppola's commentary, you've got another nine hours. Then, if you watch the bonus disc with its several more hours of material, you've got enough stuff in this box to keep you entertained and informed for nearly a twenty-four hour period. Seems like a deal to me.

Parting Thoughts:
Celluloid outlaws and hoodlums have been with us since the earliest days of Edwin S. Porter and D.W. Griffith, but, ironically, it would be the U.S. Government that indirectly encouraged Hollywood's major excursions into the world of gangsters. As a consequence of lawmakers' ill-conceived legislation leading to Prohibition in the twenties, Americans consumed more alcohol per capita than at any time before or since. Concurrently, to quench the country's thirst for illicit booze, there was an attendant rise in organized crime that would go largely unchecked for the next fifty years. Is it any wonder that Hollywood would document this phenomenon in movies of the thirties and make stars of such actors as Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, Paul Muni, Humphrey Bogart, George Raft, and others?

I'm sure no one is proud of the dark side of America's past or present, nor have most serious filmmakers attempted to glorify or glamorize the subject matter. But that hasn't stopped the public from being fascinated by gangsterism all the same. Coppola followed a time-honored Hollywood tradition in making his Corleone family trilogy, adding a depth of character, background, and narration that had never been achieved so successfully in gangster films before, a depth that would only be approached by Martin Scorsese's hard-edged ""Mean Streets,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and ""Casino"" in the years that followed. ""The Godfather"" movies represent filmmaking at its best--from their superb characterizations and acting to their innovative direction and striking camera work. Paramount's DVD presentation of the films is the best we could hope for, short of some future high-definition transfers projected on theater-sized home screens. Until that day, the present silver-disc ""Godfather Collection"" is an offer that's hard to refuse."
10125,"The Godfather III","At the beginning of The Godfather Part III, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now an aging don bent on respectability (as opposed to respect), heads up an afternoon charity function and announces his contribution of $100 million to a fund for the preservation of Sicily. The telltale sum is at once generous and obscene: Anyone who can afford to give this much is clearly not to be trusted. Yet Michael, in his way, is on the level. Having purged the Corleones of all their gambling operations, he's now intent on converting the family assets into a legitimate business enterprise. It's not so much that Michael has gone soft as that he's tired. Even monsters need to sleep.
Here, as in the first Godfather, we watch the Corleone family celebrating its prosperity, its bonds, the romance of family itself. The year is 1979, and Michael, no longer married, dances ceremoniously with his daughter (Sofia Coppola), a teenage flirt who looks more Old World Italian than he does. The scene is almost heartbreaking in its evocation of the wedding ceremony that opened the first Godfather. Even the Sinatra-like crooner Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) is on hand. He's middle-aged now, and pretty much taken for granted, though watching him run through his golden-throated shtick, one can't help but recall what had to happen — remember that severed horse's head? — in order for him to hold on to his career.
From its opening scenes, The Godfather Part III has a curious and yearning aura of atonement. Michael is desperate to make up for his sins, and so is Francis Ford Coppola, who has spent the better part of two decades straining to live up to the achievement of the first two Godfathers — perhaps the greatest fusion of artistry and popular success in the history of American movies. When Coppola signed on to direct Godfather III, he wasn't simply agreeing to carry on the saga of the Corleones, the Italian-American family who made organized crime seem at once horrifying and weirdly romantic. He was agreeing to revive the kind of richly detailed classical storytelling that has all but disappeared from the American cinema.
The miracle is that he pulls it off. The Godfather Part III isn't the overpoweringly great movie the first Godfather was (let's be reasonable — how could it have been?), and it lacks the bone-chilling gradations of darkness that made The Godfather Part II a singular American tragedy. This one is slower, talkier, and more prosaic: two hours of exposition and 40 minutes of payoff. What's more, its narrative seams sometimes show. Yet by the end, the movie has attained a deep-grained emotional grandeur that can hold its own with that of the other two films. For the first time since Apocalypse Now (1979), Coppola has recovered the gift of epic storytelling. Watching this flawed, spellbinding, end-of-a-dynasty epic, I realized that the folly of Coppola's career during the past decade — in films like One From the Heart, Rumble Fish, Peggy Sue Got Married, and Tucker: The Man and His Dream — is that he willed himself into becoming a fantasist. The Godfather Part III marks his triumphant return to operatic realism. The film revives Coppola's career even as it brings Michael Corleone's to a fittingly stark finale.
Attempting to preserve and extend his empire, Michael enters into a shady corporate deal with the Vatican, negotiating with an amusingly cynical and worldly archbishop (Donal Donnelly) who drops bottom-line figures between puffs on his cigarette. It seems that the Vatican bank is in debt and could use a fast $600 million. If Michael provides it, he can take over Immobiliare, a world-wide real-estate company of which the Vatican owns a quarter share. But the plan is too good to be true. Standing in its way is a loose conspiracy of interests extending from a John Gotti-like celebrity gangster (Joe Mantegna) to one of Michael's most trusted cronies.
What's defeating Michael isn't merely a few greedy rivals but the Mafia's eternal cycle of violence: Michael wants out, and it can't be done. Not helping matters is the emergence of Vincent (Andy Garcia), a fearless young punk stud who's the illegitimate son of Michael's late brother Sonny. Vincent is eager to join the family, and Michael, in part because his own son has rejected his criminal ways, agrees to take him on. Yet right from the start, it's clear that this grinning shark in his black-leather sports jacket lacks the discipline — the respect for his elders — required to rise in the mob. He's of the new, nihilistic generation: The Last Corleone.
The story moves to Sicily and stays there, becoming a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses. Coppola and coscreenwriter Mario Puzo have concocted a densely packed narrative that builds very slowly. The movie, however, is more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions. For Coppola is telling a story of emotional incest: He shows us a family strangled by its own blood ties. Vincent falls into a queasily intense romantic involvement with his first cousin — Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola). Meanwhile, Connie (Talia Shire), Michael's sister, has become, in effect, his surrogate wife, a shadowy schemer who hatches assassination plots when her brother hasn't the will. It's the collective pull of these two — the daughter and the sister — that draws Michael back into the fray.
Andy Garcia is as magnetic as ever, yet Vincent has been made into a standard post-De Niro hothead. And so there's no way he can become as resonant a central character as this series demands. Coppola would have done well to make him a little smarter, take him back to the U.S., and enmesh him in a booby-trapped gangster melodrama, something to offset the more meditative goings-on in Sicily.
Yet what Coppola has given us is, in its own way, richly satisfying. Pacino creates a towering portrait of a man torn between his dreams and his guilt. Michael longs for redemption yet ends up losing everything he ever cared about. He has an impromptu confession scene that is at once searing and tender, and Coppola and Puzo, borrowing liberally from headlines about the Vatican scandals of the late '70s, add a brilliantly blasphemous zinger by having his father confessor turn out to be the cardinal who is later chosen as the new pope. Talia Shire, who has never been that interesting an actress, gives the performance of her life, playing Connie with the dark stealth of a Mafia Lady Macbeth. And Eli Wallach is superb as an aging don whose grandfatherly kindliness is revealed to be a mask of treachery. As for Coppola's 19-year-old daughter, Sofia, she's obviously a nonactress, yet her Valley Girl nonchalance is apparently just what the director wanted. Coppola is saying that in a mass-culture age, even the daughter of a titan is as much a product of the world around her as she is of her family.
The movie culminates in a brilliant 30-minute-long set piece, with Coppola cutting between several related assassinations and the opera that most of the instigators are attending. It's one of the most complexly layered suspense scenes ever filmed, a kind of slow-motion Hitchcockian roller coaster. The weapons range from guns to poisoned cannoli, and one of the assassinations — a kamikaze attack on a mob boss — is more hauntingly horrific than anything in the first two Godfathers. With this sequence, Coppola unveils a vision of corruption that embraces the entire world. Yet he's also reveling in sheer theatrical magic in a way that only a master can. The entire sequence — indeed, the very movie we've been watching — becomes pure opera, as Coppola rediscovers his voice. A"
10126,"A typical affable and middling Bob Hope comedy.","A typical affable and middling Bob Hope comedy (lots of one-liners, mistaken identity gags and sight gags--plus Hope in drag), except this time it's for MGM instead of Paramount. This means lavish Technicolor and production values. The story is by Sy Bartlett and the team of writers are Everett Freeman, Don Hartman and Melville Shavelson. It's directed by David Butler (""The Road to Morocco""). Bing Crosby makes a cameo in a novel ending.

Bob Hope plays Sylvester the Great, a two-bit magician/actor on a ship ""touring"" the West Indies in the 18th century. Virginia Mayo is Princess Margaret, who is also on the ship. She's a real princess traveling in disguise because she ran away from her father who will not allow her to marry the commoner she loves. The two are kidnapped by a ruthless buccaneer called The Hook (Victor McLaglen), who has an iron claw in place of his missing hand. Though a confirmed coward, Sylvester disguises himself as a gypsy woman and with the help of a pirate, the ships's half-wit tattooer named Featherhead (Walter Brennan), is able to miraculously escape with Margaret in a dinghy. Featherhead lays on him the treasure map he stole from Captain Hook to some hidden treasure before they depart, with the condition he deliver it to his cousin. They arrive in the violent port town of Featherhead's cousin, where they must wait two weeks because the cousin won't return until then. To earn money Sylvester performs in a local cabaret. Soon Margaret is kidnapped by the corrupt governor named La Roche (Walter Slezak), who recognizes her as the missing princess and assumes Sylvester is the commoner she ran away with. Things get more dicey when it's discovered that The Hook is the secret partner of La Roche and has arrived in the port town. Sylvester also discovers that the treasure map has been tattooed onto his chest. Feeling love for the woman he doesn't believe is a princess, he acts to rescue her. The question becomes after he acts so bravely, is whether or not he will get the girl!

The film is helped considerably by strong supporting turns by Brennan, Slezak and McLaglen."
10127,"LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING","We invest Hobbits with qualities that cannot be visualized. In my mind, they are good-hearted, bustling, chatty little creatures who live in twee houses or burrows, and dress like the merry men of Robin Hood--in smaller sizes, of course. They eat seven or eight times a day, like to take naps, have never been far from home and have eyes that grow wide at the sounds of the night. They are like children grown up or grown old, and when they rise to an occasion, it takes true heroism, for they are timid by nature and would rather avoid a fight.
Such notions about Hobbits can be found in ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end ""Fellowship"" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien.
The Ring Trilogy embodies the kind of innocence that belongs to an earlier, gentler time. The Hollywood that made ""The Wizard of Oz"" might have been equal to it. But ""Fellowship"" is a film that comes after ""Gladiator"" and ""Matrix,"" and it instinctively ramps up to the genre of the overwrought special-effects action picture. That it transcends this genre--that it is a well-crafted and sometimes stirring adventure--is to its credit. But a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth it is not.
Wondering if the trilogy could possibly be as action-packed as this film, I searched my memory for sustained action scenes and finally turned to the books themselves, which I had not read since the 1970s. The chapter ""The Bridge of Khazad-Dum"" provides the basis for perhaps the most sensational action scene in the film, in which Gandalf the wizard stands on an unstable rock bridge over a chasm, and must engage in a deadly swordfight with the monstrous Balrog. This is an exciting scene, done with state-of-the-art special effects and sound that shakes the theater. In the book, I was not surprised to discover, the entire scene requires less than 500 words.
Settling down with my book, the one-volume, 1969 India paper edition, I read or skimmed for an hour or so. It was as I remembered it. The trilogy is mostly about leaving places, going places, being places, and going on to other places, all amid fearful portents and speculations. There are a great many mountains, valleys, streams, villages, caves, residences, grottos, bowers, fields, high roads, low roads, and along them the Hobbits and their larger companions travel while paying great attention to mealtimes. Landscapes are described with the faithful detail of a Victorian travel writer. The travelers meet strange and fascinating characters along the way, some of them friendly, some of them not, some of them of an order far above Hobbits or even men. Sometimes they must fight to defend themselves or to keep possession of the ring, but mostly the trilogy is an unfolding, a quest, a journey, told in an elevated, archaic, romantic prose style that tests our capacity for the declarative voice.
Reading it, I remembered why I liked it in the first place. It was reassuring. You could tell by holding the book in your hands that there were many pages to go, many sights to see, many adventures to share. I cherished the way it paused for songs and poems, which the movie has no time for. Like The Tale of Genji, which some say is the first novel, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is not about a narrative arc or the growth of the characters, but about a long series of episodes in which the essential nature of the characters is demonstrated again and again (and again). The ring, which provides the purpose for the journey, serves Tolkien as the ideal MacGuffin, motivating an epic quest while mostly staying right there on a chain around Frodo Baggins' neck.
Peter Jackson, the New Zealand director who masterminded this film (and two more to follow, in a $300 million undertaking), has made a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right; the Hobbits may not look like my idea of Hobbits (may, indeed, look like full-sized humans made to seem smaller through visual trickery), but they have the right combination of twinkle and pluck in their gaze--especially Elijah Wood as Frodo and Ian Holm as the worried Bilbo.
Yet the taller characters seem to stand astride the little Hobbit world and steal the story away. Gandalf the good wizard (Ian McKellen) and Saruman the treacherous wizard (Christopher Lee) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), who is the warrior known as Strider, are so well-seen and acted, so fearsome in battle, that we can't imagine the Hobbits getting anywhere without them. The elf Arwen (Liv Tyler), the Elf Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Arwen's father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), are not small like literary elves (""very tall they were,"" the book tells us), and here they tower like Norse gods and goddesses, accompanied by so much dramatic sound and lighting that it's a wonder they can think to speak, with all the distractions.
Jackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions. I like the way he handles crowds of Orcs in the big battle scenes, wisely knowing that in a film of this kind, realism has to be tempered with a certain fanciful fudging. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. ""This tale grew in the telling,"" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it's as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination.
That ""Fellowship of the Ring"" doesn't match my imaginary vision of Middle-earth is my problem, not yours. Perhaps it will look exactly as you think it should. But some may regret that the Hobbits have been pushed out of the foreground and reduced to supporting characters. And the movie depends on action scenes much more than Tolkien did. In a statement last week, Tolkien's son Christopher, who is the ""literary protector"" of his father's works, said, ""My own position is that 'The Lord of the Rings' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form."" That is probably true, and Jackson, instead of transforming it, has transmuted it, into a sword-and-sorcery epic in the modern style, containing many of the same characters and incidents."
10128,"Terminator, The","The Terminator, the film that catapulted Arnold Schwarzengger into Hollywood's stratosphere, was never designed for more than a niche audience. Indeed, while the film made a nice profit for Orion Pictures (returning grosses about six times its cost), it did not make the kind of money that would cause it to be labeled a ""blockbuster"" or that would justify a sequel. But The Terminator arrived at a time when America's appetite for science fiction was escalating and when the home video revolution was taking off. Although only a minor success in theaters, The Terminator was a gargantuan hit on home video. And, when James Cameron solidified his reputation by directing Aliens, it became unthinkable that there would not be a sequel to The Terminator.

The movie's strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas. This isn't a run-of-the-mill turn-off-the-brain collection of chases and fight scenes. The plot, which involves time travel and the paradoxes inherent therein, requires viewers to pay attention or risk having no idea what's happening. I remember leaving the theater 25 years ago and hearing a girl remark: ""I liked it but I didn't understand what was going on. Was that guy from the future Arnold's father?"" Cameron, as it turns out, took a little too much license in claiming full credit for the story. Noted science fiction author Harlan Ellison sued, arguing that The Terminator bore more than a passing resemblance to two of his Outer Limits teleplays, ""Soldier"" (about two time-traveling soldiers who end up in 1964, where they fight to the death) and ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" (about a time-traveling robot that looks like a man). The settlement resulted in Ellison gaining an on-tape credit as well as an undisclosed amount of money.

It is 1984. The stillness of the night is interrupted as a portal in time opens. Through that portal arrives The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a ruthless killer from the year 2029. Future Earth is at war: man against machines. The Terminator's mission is to eliminate the leader of the humans before his birth. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the eventual mother of John Connor, has been targeted for termination. But The Terminator is not the only one to make use of a time portal. Also sent through is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), John Connor's right-hand-man. His goal: protect Sarah.

The Terminator is structured as one long chase, with the vulnerable Sarah and Reese fleeing from the relentless Terminator. At first, Sarah distrusts Reese, believing him to be demented. But, once The Terminator has destroyed a police station and killed most of the cops within, she has no choice but to trust Reese. That bond develops into a romance, but The Terminator's pursuit allows little opportunity for down time or sweet nothings. Nevertheless, Cameron has a knack for getting us to care about the characters and their relationship even though not a lot of time is spent getting to know them. (There are actually more ""character building"" sequences in the more heavily action-oriented Terminator 2.)

Key special effects, which were cutting edge in 1984, appear dated by today's standards. Stan Winston's stop-animation Terminator, which takes over for Schwarzenegger at the end, looks like what it is: the product of a special effects lab. It's not credible, but the story is strong enough to overcome such shortcomings. In fact, some of the other visual chicanery - time travel effects, Schwarzenegger's makeup, and flash-forward scenes set in a post-apocalyptic 2029 - are effective. By the time Terminator 2 arrived, Cameron had both the budget and the ability to better integrate the robot Terminator into its surroundings. The herky-jerky awkwardness that marks the climax of the first movie is not evident during the sequels.

Paradoxes inevitably form the entertainment core for any time travel story, and The Terminator is no exception. (SPOILER AHEAD!) In this case, the supposition is that a person can die before he is born as long as his personal time line is unbroken. Thus, Reese comes into the world at a time after the events chronicled in The Terminator, then travels back to a date before his birth, fathers the son who will send him back, and is ""terminated"" before he is born. This is not a complex time travel concept (requiring only an understanding of time as fluid), and it's more straightforward than the one addressed in Terminator 2.

In the casting department, few character/actor pairings have been better fits than Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. In 1984, the former Mr. Olympia boasted limited feature acting experience (primarily from two Conan movies) but provided what Cameron wanted from The Terminator: an imposing physique and an implacable countenance. Schwarzenegger had both, and his Achilles heel - the occasional inability to deliver dialogue convincingly - was not an impediment. The role demanded only the occasional one-liner (one of which, ""I'll be back,"" became the actor's trademark). Cameron transformed every one of Schwarzenegger's perceived negatives into strengths and, in the process, re-defined him in Hollywood's eyes. In the wake of The Terminator, Schwarzenegger was in demand.

The film's other two leads, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, share some acting characteristics - neither has tremendous range but both are charismatic, physically adept, and provide the requisite intensity. Biehn was a Cameron ""regular"" early in his career, then moved fully into B movies, an arena where he continues to thrive. Genre fans remember him best as Hicks, Sigourney Weaver's semi-love interest from Aliens. Linda Hamilton was virtually unknown at the time of her casting. In years to come, she would reprise this role (in a considerably buffed up form), marry and divorce James Cameron (she was his fourth wife), and become a beloved cult figure for her part in the TV series Beauty and the Beast.

The potential evidenced by Cameron in The Terminator - the ability to sustain suspense, meld action with story, and provide compelling characters despite the limitations of the actors portraying them - would be fully realized in two future features, Aliens and Terminator 2. This movie, however, is in some ways more impressive than either of those because of what the filmmaker was capable of achieving with a limited budget and without significant studio backing. The themes and ideas presented in The Terminator hold up well today, even though we have moved into the post-Cold War era and only the most nihilistic individuals could see 2029 in such bleak terms. It's a rousing science fiction story that proves an on-screen adrenaline rush need not short-circuit the brain."
10129,"Spirited Away","To animators across the world, Hayao Miyazaki is a god. Within the animation community, his work is revered, and fans of “anime” (Japanese animation) await each new Miyazaki film with the same degree of ill-concealed impatience as displayed by 11-year olds hungering for the next book in the “Harry Potter” series. In mainstream United States movie-going circles, Miyazaki is not a well-known name, which is one reason why, several years ago, Walt Disney Pictures purchased the North American rights to Miyazaki’s catalog. While there were some gripes about the manner in which the dubbing and distribution of Miyazaki’s previous feature, Princess Mononoke, were handled here, more care has been taken for Spirited Away. Two American animation luminaries – Pixar’s John Lasseter and Disney’s Kirk Wise (the director of several animated features, including Beauty and the Beast) – were recruited to convert the Japanese version of the movie into one for English-speaking audiences.

Let me state up front that I am neither a fan of, nor an expert on, anime. In fact, I’m not a lover of animation in general. But I know when I’m in the presence of good storytelling, and Spirited Away represents that. Watching this movie, you immediately become aware of two things – the animation is excellent (something that will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen one of Miyazaki’s previous outings) and the story turns in unusual, often unexpected directions. One of the biggest problems I have with many animated films (even the best ones) is plot predictability. That’s not the case here.

Spirited Away takes influences from “Alice in Wonderland” and “The Wizard of Oz” and uses them to fashion a highly original story about a 10 year-old girl, Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase), who, along with her parents, ventures through a tunnel that leads to the world of spirits. After a witch, Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), turns Mom and Dad into pigs, Chihiro must find a niche in the spirit world, where humans are not well thought-of, and figure out a way to convince Yubaba to change her parents back into humans and send them all home. With help from Haku (Jason Marsden), Yubaba’s boy apprentice, and Lin (Susan Egan), a “big sister” type, Chihiro gets a job at Yubaba’s bathhouse for sprits, and there her quest to aid her family begins. But, as complications arise, she finds additional tasks to perform and other allies willing to help her.

The nature of the story is tailor-made for animation. Many of the characters engage in shape-shifting (boys become dragons, adults become pigs, a giant baby becomes a bloated mouse) and the bathhouse is frequented by a variety of strange and unusual creatures. While a few of the inhabitants of the sprit world look human, most appear to be anything but that. Take the boiler operator Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers), for example. At first glance, he’s just a cranky old man with a frizzy beard. Then we notice that he has eight legs and walks like a spider. We also find out that he’s not as intimidating as he looks. His initially surly disposition melts away and he becomes of one Chihiro’s numerous friends.

Miyazaki is an environmentalist, and his films often contain strong pro-environment messages. (This was a cornerstone to Princess Mononoke.) In Spirited Away, one of the visitors to the bathhouse is a river spirit who has been so badly polluted by sludge and other waste materials that his stench drives people away and he is in need of a powerful cleansing to sluice away the filth. It takes an effort, but he is eventually restored to his former glory.

The film’s animation is stunning, with richly-detailed backgrounds and flawless foregrounds. Unlike many animators, Miyazaki still relies almost exclusively upon hand-drawn artwork (although he employs some computer technology to touch up and enhance the final product), and his meticulous care shows. The colors are bright and vivid, and some of the scenes (especially those taking place during a rainstorm) are peerless in the world of motion picture animation. Also, with a running length that exceeds two hours (124 minutes), Spirited Away requires approximately 40% more cells than what is needed for the average Disney release.

Miyazaki does not dumb down Spirited Away, even though his stated target audience is children. This is a true family film, in that adults will be as enchanted by the characters and situations as children will. The pace is a little slower than the average animated film – there is not as much frantic action – but not so languid that younger viewers will become restless. The dubbing into English is very good (as is voice selection), so there is no subtitle barrier. Overall, while Spirited Away may not be as complex and imaginative as Princess Mononoke in some areas, it is as beautifully rendered and no less sophisticated in its outlook. Miyazaki has provided another triumph, and, in the midst of the quality fall-off of Disney’s in-house animated projects, a reason for animation-lovers to rejoice."

Variety Staff
The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu. In addition, the $55 million-plus production is the most personal of the three for the director.

Like the original, Part III opens with a lengthy festival celebration punctuated by backroom dealings. It is 1979, and Michael Corleone, having divested himself of his illegal operations, is being honored by the Catholic Church for his abundant charitable activities.

Hopeful of bringing his family closer together, Michael dotes on his daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), and understandably becomes perturbed by her affair with cousin Vincent (Andy Garcia), hot-headed, violence-prone illegitimate son of Michael’s late brother Sonny. Vincent has been unhappily working for slumlord and old-style thug Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who has taken on Michael’s less savory holdings.

Bad blood between the ruthless Zasa and the Corleone family mounts just as Michael tries, with $600 million, to buy a controlling interest in the European conglomerate Immobiliare, a move that would cement his business legitimacy and financial future.

After 80 minutes, the action switches to Italy, where it remains for the duration. Pacino and Eli Wallach’s old dons can’t help begin scheming against one another. In one of the most masterful examples of sustained intercutting in cinema, the performance on opening night of Pacino’s son in Cavalleria Rusticana serves as the backdrop for several murderous missions.

For the third time out in his career role, Pacino is magnificent. Garcia brings much-needed youth and juice to the ballsy Vincent, heir apparent to the Corleone tradition, much as James Caan sparked the first film and Robert De Niro invigorated the second.

Diane Keaton proves a welcome, if brief, presence in warming the film, and Talia Shire seems pleased with the opportunity to do some dirty work at long last.

Film’s main flaw, unavoidably, is Sofia Coppola in the important, but not critical, role of Michael’s daughter. Unfortunate casting decision was made after original actress Winona Ryder had to bow out at the start of production."
10131,"Screen: 'Alien 'Brings Chills From the Far Galaxy:","A GIGANTIC construction moves serenely through space where, though the night never ends, there's always enough light to see strange objects. This one looks like the main set of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance."" It's as if Babylon had been cut loose from earth to sail back through space to its own time. In actual fact, it's the cargo-ship Nostromo on its return to earth at the end of an extended voyage to the far end of the galaxy.

When we go inside, the ship appears to have been as suddenly deserted as the Marie Celeste. We wander down empty corridors into abandoned living quarters, into engine rooms and, finally, into the command room where the computers are the only signs of life. The interior of the ship is vast. It contains the kind of waste space one seldom sees anymore except in some rare old Manhattan pile like the Dakota. Something decidedly eerie is going on.

Thus — familiarly but with immense promise — begins ""Alien,"" Ridley Scott's new, elaborately produced science-fiction film that opens today at the Criterion and other theaters. However, as this voyage continues, familiarity consumes the promise and leaves as residue the memory of some shrieks from shocks of a most mundane kind.

The crew of the Nostromo has not vanished. They are merely sleeping the time away and, shortly after the opening credits, they come forth from their sleep-pods to prepare for their re-entry into the earth's orbit. It's then that they encounter peculiar signals from the wreck of another space ship, one from another galaxy and one which has crashed onto an uncharted planetoid. The Nostromo stops to investigate, locates the craft and, when it takes off again for earth, it carries aboard a specimen of alien life, a small, octopus-like blob that won't stop growing and — possibly worse — is ""unclouded by conscience or delusions of morality.""

That's about all one should or can say about the story originally conceived by Dan O'Bannon and turned into a screenplay by him and Ronald Shusett.

""Alien"" is an extremely small, rather decent movie of its modest kind, set inside a large, extremely fancy physical production. Don't race to it expecting the wit of ""Star Wars"" or the metaphysical pretentions of ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" At its best it recalls ""The Thing,"" though the Howard Hawks film was both more imaginatively and more economically dramatized.

It's an old-fashioned scare movie about something that is not only implacably evil but prone to jumping out at you when (the movie hopes) you least expect it. There was once a time when this sort of thing was set in an old dark house, on a moor, in a thunderstorm. Being trendy, Mr. Scott and his associates have sent it up in space.

As he demonstrated with ""The Duellists,"" his first feature, Mr. Scott is a very stylish director. Though ""Alien"" is not the seminal science-fiction film one wants from him, it's executed with a good deal of no-nonsense verve. The members of the small cast are uniformly good though, with two exception, the roles might have been written by a computor.

Sigourney Weaver is impressive and funny as the Nostromo's executive officer, the second in command, a young woman who manages to act tough, efficient and sexy all at the same time. Ian Holm is also excellent as the ship's science officer, a man with a secret that will set him apart from everyone else forever.

Other members of the crew are played by Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright, the actress who was so good in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" She plays a somewhat similar role here, one that requires her to weep a lot and leaves her so red-eyed and red-nosed that she may be in danger of becoming the Isable Jewell of the living-color space-age.

""Alien's"" sets and special effects are well done, but these things no longer surprise or tantalize us as they once did. In a very short time, science-fiction films have developed their own jargon that's now become a part of the grammar of film. You know the sort of stuff I mean — the shots of blinking instrument panels, of wildly bleeping computers, of cryptic messages clattering in square type-faces across televisio screens. There's also the obligatory shot of that huge space vehicle early on in every film. It appears from over our right shoulder, passes over our head and then proceeds slowly and majestically toward the far distance at screen-left. When I first saw it in ""2001,"" it was awesome. Now it makes me feel like a turtle on a busy though unnaturally quiet highway."
10132,BRAVEHEART,"Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged.
Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor.
Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was ""freedom!"" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of ""Braveheart,"" which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of ""The Road Warrior."" What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, ""Braveheart"" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?).
Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but ""Braveheart"" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: ""Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -."" Uh, huh.
In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I (""Longshanks""), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong.
Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. ""I may have to conceive the child myself!"" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or ""first night,"" nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers.
The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window).
Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, ""because of the way you look at me."" The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths.
These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, ""That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!"") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling.
And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can."
10133,"BATMAN BEGINS","'Batman Begins"" at last penetrates to the dark and troubled depths of the Batman legend, creating a superhero who, if not plausible, is at least persuasive as a man driven to dress like a bat and become a vigilante. The movie doesn't simply supply Batman's beginnings in the tradition of a comic book origin story, but explores the tortured path that led Bruce Wayne from a parentless childhood to a friendless adult existence. The movie is not realistic, because how could it be, but it acts as if it is.
Opening in a prison camp in an unnamed nation, ""Batman Begins"" shows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) enduring brutal treatment as a prisoner, as part of his research into the nature of evil. He is rescued by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who appoints himself Wayne's mentor, teaches him sword-fighting and mind control, and tries to enlist him in his amoral League of Shadows (""We burned London to the ground"").
When Wayne refuses to kill someone as a membership requirement, Ducard becomes his enemy; the reclusive millionaire returns to Gotham City determined to fight evil, without realizing quite how much trouble he is in.
The story of why he identifies with bats (childhood trauma) and hates evildoers (he saw his parents killed by a mugger) has been referred to many times in the various incarnations of the Batman legend, including four previous films. This time, it is given weight and depth. Wayne discovers in Gotham that the family Wayne Corp. is run by a venal corporate monster (Rutger Hauer), but that in its depths labors the almost forgotten scientific genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who understands Wayne wants to fight crime and offers him the weaponry.
Lucius happens to have on hand a prototype Batmobile, which unlike the streamlined models in the earlier movies, is a big, unlovely juggernaut that looks like a Humvee's wet dream. He also devises a bat-cape with surprising properties.
These preparations, Gotham crime details and the counsel of the faithful servant Alfred (Michael Caine) delay the actual appearance of Batman until the second act of the movie. We don't mind. Unlike the earlier films, which delighted in extravagant special-effects action, ""Batman Begins"" is shrouded in shadow; instead of high-detail, sharp-edged special effects, we get obscure developments in fog and smoke, reinforced by a superb sound-effects design. And Wayne himself is a slow learner, clumsy at times, taking foolish chances, inventing Batman as he goes along.
This is at last the Batman movie I've been waiting for. The character resonates more deeply with me than the other comic superheroes, perhaps because when I discovered him as a child, he seemed darker and more grown-up than the cheerful Superman. He has secrets. As Alfred muses: ""Strange injuries and a nonexistent social life. These things beg the question, what does Bruce Wayne do with his time?""
What he does is create a high profile as a millionaire playboy who gets drunk and causes scenes. This disappoints Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), his friend since childhood, who is now an assistant D.A. She and Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), apparently Gotham City's only honest cop, are faced with a local crime syndicate led by Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). But Falcone's gang is child's play, compared to the deep scheme being hatched by the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), who, in the tradition of Victorian alienists, likes to declare his enemies insane and lock them up.
Crane's secret identity as the Scarecrow fits into a scheme to lace the Gotham water supply with a psychedelic drug. Then a superweapon will be used to vaporize the water, citizens will inhale the drug, and it will drive them crazy, for reasons which the Scarecrow and his confederates explain with more detail than clarity. Meanwhile, flashbacks establish the character's deepest traumas, including his special relationship with bats and his guilt because he thinks he is responsible for his parents' mugging.
I admire, among other things, the way the movie doesn't have the gloss of the earlier films. The Batman costume is an early design. The Bat Cave is an actual cave beneath Wayne Manor. The Batmobile enters and leaves it by leaping across a chasm and through a waterfall. The Bat Signal is crude and out of focus.
The movie was shot on location in Chicago, making good use of the murky depths of lower Wacker Drive and the Board of Trade building (now the Wayne Corp.). Special effects add a spectacular monorail down La Salle Street, which derails in the best scene along those lines since ""The Fugitive.""
Bale is just right for this emerging version of Batman. It's strange to see him muscular and toned, after his cadaverous appearance in ""The Machinist,"" but he suggests an inward quality that suits the character. Rachel is at first fooled by his facade of playboy irresponsibility, but Lt. Gordon figures out fairly quickly what Batman is doing, and why. Instead of one villain as the headliner, ""Batman Begins"" has a whole population, including Falcone, the Scarecrow, the Asian League of Shadows leader Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and a surprise bonus pick.
The movie has been directed by Christopher Nolan, still only 35, whose ""Memento"" (2000) took Sundance by storm and was followed by ""Insomnia"" (2002), a police procedural with Al Pacino. What Warner Bros. saw in those pictures that inspired them to think of Nolan is hard to say, but the studio guessed correctly, and after an eight-year hiatus, the Batman franchise has finally found its way.
I said this is the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for, because I didn't realize that more emphasis on story and character and less emphasis on high-tech action was just what was needed. The movie works dramatically in addition to being an entertainment. There's something to it."
10134,"The Godfather Part III","Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather Part III"" isn't just a disappointment, it's a failure of heartbreaking proportions. Admittedly, ""The Godfather"" I and II, which are universally acclaimed as among the greatest works of the American cinema, are a tough act to follow; a very good film might be put alongside them and still not measure up. ""Godfather III,"" though, adds little more than a sad footnote to those earlier works.

The film completes the story of Vito Corleone and his sons, bringing us from the point at which the second film ended to the present day, from that image of an isolated Michael (Al Pacino) looking out from his boathouse office as the orders for his brother's murder are executed, to the anticlimactic ending. But in supplying the final chapter of the saga, it also sullies what came before. It makes you wish it had never been made.

Coppola's star has dimmed significantly over the 16 years since the last ""Godfather"" film, but to see this third installment is to watch it fall out of the sky altogether. ""The Godfather Part III"" is the work of an artist estranged from his talent, a lost soul. In continuing the story of the Corleones, not only does Coppola fail to build on what he and his screenwriter Mario Puzo previously created; he also seems oblivious to what had made his story so compelling to begin with.

The characters that carry over from the earlier films bear little resemblance to themselves. The dread curve of Michael Corleone's life, which provided a dramatic spine for the family saga, has lost its sinister bend. At the beginning of ""Part III,"" Michael has come very close to realizing his dream of a completely legitimate family business. At a ceremony in his New York penthouse, he receives the Order of St. Sebastian from the Catholic Church, a lofty honor that may be connected to the $100 million donation given to the church by the Vito Corleone Foundation, a charity run by Michael's daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola). But this first act doesn't have the dramatic resonance of the wedding scene in ""Part I,"" or the celebration of Michael's son Anthony's first communion in ""Part II,"" because Michael no longer sits like a malignant spider at the center of his Mafia web. Michael is a businessman now, and in divesting himself of his criminal interests he has lost what made him interesting, his murderous darkness.

It's nearly impossible to see how the relentlessly brutal middle-aged man at the end of ""Part II"" could have grown into the relaxed, polished, easy-moving older one we see here. In some scenes -- like one in which he urges Vincent (Andy Garcia), his brother Sonny's hotheaded bastard son, to make the peace with a rival, Joey Zaza (Joe Mantegna) -- he seems almost charming -- a smiling, glad-handing lightweight. The action here takes place past the point where there is anything at stake, and it has, at times, an almost meditative quality, an old man's summing up.

With Michael missing from the film's center, the rest of the action seems ungrounded; it loses its moral dimension and becomes just another mob story. The two main plot threads concern the Corleone family's dealing with the Vatican, and Vincent's emergence as Michael's successor. The motives for Garcia's Vincent aren't split, the way Michael's have been. Violence is natural to him. He suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf, and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way Don Vito Corleone was. Garcia, as a result, seems to be the only actor in the film who knows what he's playing, the only one with a clear mission, and he gives a thrilling, feral performance. It's the film's strongest.

Pacino, for his part, flails around inside his character. His makeup is superb, though if he had been allowed to sweep back his hair it might have connected him physically to Garcia (and to Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, as well). Sometimes his choices are intriguing, and at times he draws something interesting to the surface of his performance. For the most part, though, he busies himself by paying attention to the details of playing an older man -- Michael is around 60 -- and goes not much deeper than that.

Some of Coppola's choices -- for example, having Michael collapse suddenly into a diabetic coma when it was never mentioned that he suffers from the disease -- appear to have been made out of desperation. And some of the plotting -- particularly the handling of a conflict between the Corleones and the Luchese family over control of the Vatican's massive corporate holdings -- is tangled beyond comprehension. Some scenes -- such as the ones with Diane Keaton as Michael's wife, Kay -- are in the film because of studio politics, and not because Puzo and Coppola have anything of importance to say in them.

Even though she is authoritative in the role, Keaton suffers tremendously from having no real function except to nag Michael for his past sins. (She's also anchored with some of the film's most painful dialogue.) Eli Wallach has a few hammy moments as Don Altabello, an old mob friend who turns out to be an enemy. Bridget Fonda, who plays a journalist, has only two small scenes that contribute nothing whatsoever, and George Hamilton contributes a few atrocious moments as the family's PR man. Talia Shire's part as Michael's sister, Connie, has been expanded in ""Part III,"" but the conception for the character seems to vary from scene to scene, so that at one moment she's a screaming crackpot and the next a power-hungry behind-the-scenes plotter.

The romance between Mary and Vincent is one of the film's main subplots, and as Mary, Sofia Coppola is hopelessly amateurish. Still, the part is a relatively small one, and her failure -- contrary to much that has already been written -- contributes very little to what is actually wrong with the film.

It may be that Coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say. As an epic metaphor for the American dream, the first two ""Godfather"" films are nearly perfect. The connections they made go deep into the story of this country, deep into our sense of ourselves and the contradictions in our lives. As a generational story, they had the richness and scope of Shakespeare. But the man who made those two masterpieces is not the man who has given us this failed final chapter. Though he reassembled many of the members of his old team -- his actors, Puzo, cinematographer Gordon Willis and production designer Dean Tavoularis -- his talent for filmmaking is eclipsed now by his gift for self-destruction. If that great earlier artist ever had a chance of resurfacing, it was here. But he didn't and you can't help but see ""The Godfather Part III"" as his headstone."
10135,"THE GODFATHER","We know from Gay Talese’s book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn’t all sunshine and roses. More often, it’s the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of “The Godfather,” which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what’s left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.

The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo’s novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn’t give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.
The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone’s family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.
“The Godfather” himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father’s position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather’s role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.
Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.
But Brando’s performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.
The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although “The Godfather” is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn’t time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he’ll have to cancel his day at the races).
The success of “The Godfather” as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn’t miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone’s daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.
Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so “The Godfather” becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they’d tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn’t have worked. But it’s uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.
Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can’t quite understand unless you’ve read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
10136,"Miami Vice","The two best words to describe the 2006 motion picture Miami Vice are ""stylish"" and ""intense."" One of those descriptors without the other could lead one to suspect a pretentious bore or a pointless exercise in action but, by pairing them, writer/director Michael Mann has crafted a gripping, visually interesting motion picture that doesn't fail on the basis of its needlessly convoluted plot and its hit-or-miss character arcs. As police dramas go, Miami Vice never loses its audience, in part because it is unpredictable (you never feel like anyone, even the lead characters, is destined to survive the proceedings) and in part because it never slows down.

Calling the film Miami Vice is unnecessary - a marketing artifact. Aside from a few character names, little of the 1980s TV show remains in the motion picture. The movie is more reminiscent of Mann's films Heat and Collateral than it is of the television program his name became associated with. Viewers who go into Miami Vice with the baggage of expectations may be disappointed by what they find. Like The Untouchables, this is a case in which the big screen version is a complete re-imagining of its small screen forebear. There are no cutting edge fashions. The music is new (even ""In the Air Tonight"" is a cover). And there are no cameos or instances of original stars reprising roles. (Although Edward James Olmos was offered the opportunity to return as Lt. Castillo, scheduling conflicts with Battlestar Galactica forced him to decline.)

The premise has Miami cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) going undercover to discover and plug a leak in the FBI that has resulted in a busted sting and several deaths. Posing as transportation experts, they meet with drug smuggler Jose Yero (John Oritz) and his associate, Isabella (Gong Li), to propose that they replace Yero's current distribution apparatus and handle shipments of his illegal merchandise to the United States. Yero is suspicious, but his boss, Montoya (Luis Tosar), overrules him. Meanwhile, Isabella acts as Montoya's go-between and begins an affair with Crockett.

When it comes down to it, there's not a lot of action in Miami Vice, and most of it occurs during the final 30 minutes. Mann is an expert at sleight of hand, however, and the film seems more combustible than it is. A lot of that has to do with the throbbing soundtrack and a pervasive sense of danger. Scenes such as the one in which Crockett and Tubbs introduce themselves to Yero aren't violent, but they bubble with the potential for a bloodbath. Likewise, Crockett's affair with Isabella treads along the razor's edge of betrayal and catastrophe.

The romantic interaction of the leads help to humanize them, broadening them beyond the confines of the stereotypical ""rogue cops"" - tight partners who don't play by the rules. There's chemistry in the seemingly unlikely pairing of Gong Li and Colin Farrell. Less attention is paid to the liaison between Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris' Trudy Joplin, but this relationship has an important outcome.

Farrell and Foxx are fine in their roles as long as one doesn't start comparing them to Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. We believe these two are the smartest, slickest cops to do this job - fearless in the face of death and willing to risk everything. One senses that the real payoff may not be getting the bad guys, but getting off on the adrenaline of the chase and the thrill of dancing with the devil. International Chinese superstar Gong Li has difficulty with her English and Spanish (although, to be fair, there was little of her minimal dialogue that I didn't understand), but she does her best acting non-verbally. Her sex scene with Farrell is moving, as we see tears in her eyes. Thereafter, we observe the previously icy exterior thaw. John Ortiz is okay as the chief antagonist, although he's hardly likely to challenge Alan Rickman or Dennis Hopper for a spot in the Villains' Hall of Fame.

There's a noticeable absence of red in Miami Vice, with blues being amplified. Contrast is low in many night scenes, with noticeable grain. Whether these stylistic choices benefit Miami Vice is open to debate, but they give the film a distinct look. In many ways, the movie has a dirtier, grittier feel than its TV counterpart. The '80s Miami Vice was pastels; the 2006 version is dark and at times almost monochromatic.

The best way to view this new Miami Vice is as something unconnected to its previous incarnation. That way, this version and the new interpretations of the actors can be allowed to stand on their own. As cop movies go, Miami Vice does interesting things with unoriginal material. This is to its credit - movies with more have failed, while this one succeeds on the basis of its fervor and immediacy. It's not the ultimate as either a cop movie or a TV adaptation, but it's better than average in both categories."
10137,"STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN","The peculiar thing about Spock is that, being half human and half Vulcan and therefore possessing about half the usual quota of human emotions, he consistently, if dispassionately, behaves as if he possessed very heroic human emotions indeed. He makes a choice in “Star Trek II” that would be made only by a hero, a fool, or a Vulcan. And when he makes his decision, the movie rises to one of its best scenes, because the ""Star Trek"" stories have always been best when they centered around their characters. Although I liked the special effects in the first movie, they were probably not the point; fans of the TV series wanted to see their favorite characters again, and “Trek II” understood that desire and acted on it. 
Time has passed since the last episode. Kirk has retired to an administrative post. Spock is commanding the Enterprise, with a lot of new faces in the crew. The ship is on a mission concerning the Genesis device, a new invention which, if I understand it correctly, is capable of seeding a barren planet with luxuriant life. A sister ship, the USS Reliant, is scouting for lifeless planets and finds one that seems to be dead, but its instruments pick up a small speck of life. Crew members investigate, and find the planet inhabited by an outlaw named Khan, who was exiled there years ago by Kirk, and has brooded of vengeance ever since. 
Khan is played as a cauldron of resentment by Ricardo Montalban, and his performance is so strong that he helps illustrate a general principle involving not only Star Trek but “Star Wars” (1977) and all the epic serials, especially the “James Bond” movies: Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph. In a curious way, Khan captures our sympathy, even though he is an evil man who introduces loathsome creatures into the ear canals of two Enterprise crew members. Montalban doesn't overact. He plays the character as a man of deeply wounded pride, whose bond of hatred with Admiral Kirk is stronger even than his traditional villain's desire to rule the universe. 
There is a battle in outer space in this movie, a particularly inept one that owes more to ""Captain Video"" than to state-of-the-art special effects. I always love it when they give us spaceships capable of leaping across the universe, and then arm them with weapons so puny that a direct hit merely blows up a few control boards and knocks people off their feet. Somehow, though, I don't much care if the battles aren't that amazing, because the story doesn't depend on them. It's about a sacrifice made by Spock, and it draws on the sentiment and audience identification developed over the years by the TV series. 
Perhaps because of that bond, and the sense that an episode may be over but the Enterprise will carry on, the movie doesn't feel that it needs an ending in a conventional sense. The film closes with the usual ""Star Trek"" end narration, all about the ship's mission and its quest, and we are obviously being set up for a sequel. You could almost argue that the last few minutes of “Trek II” are a trailer for “Trek III”, but, no, that wouldn't be in the spirit of the Enterprise, would it?"
10138,Gladiator,"It's tough selling bloody heroism on a Homeric scale to a younger crowd raised on Luke Skywalker and Rambo. These days, the machinery of spectacle has gotten so sophisticated and so stunt-driven that emotional depth only slows a guy down. (The apotheosis of hero-dude blankness: Keanu Reeves' Neo in The Matrix.) Yet it's Steven Spielberg, grand wizard of stunts and special effects, who has most influentially steered contemporary notions of bravery back along older-fashioned routes. Grand and rousing, Gladiator owes its shape and scope to the splashy historical ''sword-and-sandal movies'' of the 1950s and '60s, legendary cinema circuses like Ben-Hur and Spartacus. But Maximus (Russell Crowe), the charismatic general who stands at the center of director Ridley Scott's giant arena, is, but for the breastplate, shield, and (when goaded into it) bloodthirsty fury, a brother-in-attitude of Tom Hanks' Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan. They're decent men forced by circumstance to perform extraordinary feats, faithful husbands who just want to go home, but who take up arms instead to fix a broken world. (They're also both attached to units out of DreamWorks, Spielberg's global theater of operations.)
Like Private Ryan, Gladiator charges into heart-pounding battle just minutes into the first reel. Assembling his Roman legions for an assault on a barbarian horde, Maximus, the well-liked leader, circulates easily among his troops. ''At my signal—unleash hell!'' he orders, whereupon Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. It's a bravura sequence of flaming arrows, falling horses, and mortal combat that doesn't copy Private Ryan's famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. It's Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe.
The victory pleases Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who loves Maximus more than he does his own weak yet treacherous son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), or Commodus' shrewd, comely sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). The dying emperor would like the Spanish-born Maximus to succeed him, paving the way for Rome to once again become a republic, but Commodus doesn't take the news well; for an indolent weasel, he's remarkably resourceful about killing everyone Maximus loves. He nearly succeeds in having Maximus killed, too. Wounded, the general escapes but is then captured by slave traders, sold into bondage, and marked for certain death under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), a cynical supplier of gladiators for all occasions.
Maximus' incognito return to Rome to fight in the Colosseum (in front of the new emperor, Commodus), his quick rise to fame as the town's winningest warrior, and his big showdown with his old adversary fill the last act of Gladiator—as do a dazzling display of old-time Roman crowd scenes and stadium acts conjured with computerized magic that would have slayed old sandal-movie showmen like William Wyler and Cecil B. DeMille. But as much as the director's mise-en-scène dazzles, this is the rare Ridley Scott production in which individual characters have relatively secure separate identities. Certainly those incorrigible old thespians Harris and Reed play the bejaysus out of their character roles; there's also a deliciously creepy perversity elegantly mustered by Phoenix. (His Commodus is entirely too enamored of his sister, but then again, as happens in such muscle-bound extravaganzas, Lucilla appears to be the only woman residing in all of the Eternal City.) And it's a sly pleasure to see Derek Jacobi tied in a toga again as the empire's most reputable senator, some two decades after the actor starred on public television in the definitive Roman historical saga, I, Claudius.
Gladiator, though, is Crowe's to win or lose—Caesar's thumb up or thumb down, as it were. And he wins, colossally. The New Zealand-born, Australian-raised actor's performances have each been so completely different from one another, his transformation so complete and self-abnegating as to erase the notion of a fundamental Russell Crowe. Previously, this disarming lack of a portable, consistent, publicity-friendly acting personality has gotten in the way of his becoming a marquee star. Not any more. The puffy, ashen whistle-blower Crowe played in The Insider (for which he jolly well deserved the Oscar) has vanished, replaced by a brawny army general used to working the land.
This Maximus, with his lovely, meaty 1950s body mass like that of a William Holden or Robert Mitchum, has a farmer's vanity-free self-confidence; he needs to hold and smell a handful of the earth before each battle. Heartily masculine, commanding yet capable of temperance, and with a warily, wearily understanding gaze, Crowe makes Maximus' desire to go home when his job is done the greatest aspiration a man can have. Whether or not he gets there in the end doesn't matter. What matters for today's hero is the good fight, and Gladiator KOs us with a doozy. A-"
10139,"Ocean's Twelve","This heist movie directed by Steven Soderbergh has nothing on its mind except to entertain us with the antics of some talented and competitive men who are drop-outs from regular society. Three years after robbing casino kingpin Terry Benedict, members of the Ocean's Eleven gang are told that they have two weeks to pay back — with interest — the millions they took from him. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is living in suburbia with his wife, Tess (Julia Roberts); Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) is in the hotel business; Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) is producing an album; and the others have been off on their own spending money until this unexpected day of reckoning brings them all back together again.

They gather in Amsterdam to plan a big heist only to find themselves in competition with the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel), Europe's top thief, who is being pursued by Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an intrepid Interpol investigator. This rich and self-absorbed man arranges a race to steal the Faberge Coronation Egg from a Rome art museum. Meanwhile, complications ensue when Ocean discovers that Isabel used to be Rusty's lover and is not adverse to using him in her own scheme to catch the Night Fox.

Everyone in the movie seems to be having fun, and many bits work well, including a scene where Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) tries to prove that he can move in the same high circle with Danny and Rusty. Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould are funny when they are called upon to be eccentric, and Bruce Willis carries off the humor in an extended cameo involving a visit by the actress Julia Roberts to the Rome art museum. Soderbergh displays a light touch throughout. It's a lark to watch this top-drawer cast strutting their stuff in such a playful manner."
10140,"THE BIG LEBOWSKI","The Coen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski'' is a genial, shambling comedy about a human train wreck, and should come with a warning like the one Mark Twain attached to ""Huckleberry Finn'': ""Persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.'' It's about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is described by the narrator as ""the laziest man in Los Angeles County.'' He lives only to go bowling, but is mistaken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with dire consequences.
This is the first movie by Joel and Ethan Coen since ""Fargo.'' Few movies could equal that one, and this one doesn't--but it's weirdly engaging, like its hero. The Dude is played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, a potbelly, a ponytail and a pair of Bermuda shorts so large they may have been borrowed from his best friend and bowling teammate, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Their other teammate is Donny (Steve Buscemi), who may not be very bright, but it's hard be sure since he never is allowed to complete a sentence.
Everybody knows somebody like the Dude--and so, rumor has it, do the Coen brothers. They based the character on a movie producer and distributor named Jeff Dowd, a familiar figure at film festivals, who is tall, large, shaggy and aboil with enthusiasm. Dowd is much more successful than Lebowski (he has played an important role in the Coens' careers as indie filmmakers), but no less a creature of the moment. Both dudes depend on improvisation and inspiration much more than organization.
In spirit, ""The Big Lebowski'' resembles the Coens' ""Raising Arizona,'' with its large cast of peculiar characters and its strangely wonderful dialogue. Here, in a film set at the time of the Gulf War, are characters whose speech was shaped by earlier times: Vietnam (Walter), the flower power era (the Dude) and ""Twilight Zone'' (Donny). Their very notion of reality may be shaped by the limited ways they have to describe it. One of the pleasures of ""Fargo'' was the way the Coens listened carefully to how their characters spoke. Here, too, note that when the In & Out Burger shop is suggested for a rendezvous, the Dude supplies its address: That's the sort of precise information he would possess.
As the film opens, the Dude is visited by two enforcers for a porn king (Ben Gazzara) who is owed a lot of money by the Big Lebowski's wife. The goons of course have the wrong Lebowski, but before they figure that out, one already has urinated on the Dude's rug, causing deep enmity: ""That rug really tied the room together,'' the Dude mourns. Walter, the Viet vet, leads the charge for revenge. Borrowing lines directly from President George Bush on TV, he vows that ""this aggression will not stand'' and urges the Dude to ""draw a line in the sand.'' The Dude visits the other Lebowski (David Huddleston), leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself enlisted in the millionaire's schemes. The rich Lebowski, in a wheelchair and gazing into a fireplace like Maj. Amberson in ""The Magnificent Ambersons,'' tells the Dude that his wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), has been kidnapped. He wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. This plan is opposed by Maude (Julianne Moore), the Big Lebowski's daughter from an earlier marriage. Moore, who played a porno actress in ""Boogie Nights,'' here plays an altogether different kind of erotic artist; she covers her body with paint and hurls herself through the air in a leather harness.
Los Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he's socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.) Some may complain ""The Big Lebowski'' rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style. The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings. The spirit is established right at the outset, when the narrator (Sam Elliott) starts out well enough, but eventually confesses he's lost his train of thought."
10141,GLADIATOR,"It's been almost four decades since the last epic sword and sandal flick, Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus,"" and Ridley Scott, a great visualist (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"") seemed a promising choice to resurrect the genre. While ""Gladiator"" has its merits, it doesn't fully return on its hype investment.

The intense Australian actor Crowe is physically imposing as Maximus, although his intensity translates mostly to dourness here. The film opens as the farmer runs his hand through his golden field of wheat before spying his wife and small son - an image that will echo throughout the movie. Maximus initially refuses to cooperate with his new owner Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a Gladiator trainer, but impresses with his skills when he's put in a fight or die situation.

Meanwhile, Commodus, who wants to squelsh the Senate his father had wished to rule Rome, announces 150 days of games (which his father had outlawed) in the Colliseum in order to win the love of the people. His sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen, ""Mission to Mars""), who once loved Maximus, appeases her brother only to protect her young son Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).

When Maximus and his compatriots enter the Colliseum cast as the Barbarians in the Battle of Carthage they reinvent history by winning an upset victory. Commodore raises his thumb and asks to meet the Spaniard but is aghast to find his foe still alive. Worse, Maximus wins the love of not only Commodus' people but of his sister Lucilla, whom Commodus lusts after. Lucilla risks all by joining forces with Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi, ""I, Claudius"") and clandestinely meeting with Maximus to plot against her brother.

Standouts in the cast include Joaquin Phoenix, who gives a tortured, tentative performance as the conflicted Commodus, his maturest turn to date. In his last role, Oliver Reed is amazingly restrained and surprisingly likeable. (Reed died during production and one scene features computer trickery to include him.) Richard Harris is an affecting, if unlikely, Aurelius and Djimon Hounsou (""Amistad"") is a noble friend to Maximus. Nielsen looks fine as Lucilla but doesn't offer much dramatic punch.

Screenwriter William Nicholson emphasizes the spiritual and family in this dark epic. Although there's plenty of action, director Scott has oddly chosen murky visual effects combined with tight close up takes of his gladiator bouts which don't give the viewer a sense of epic sweep the genre cries out for. The hyper reality effects used in the battle of Germania and tiger fighting sequences played really well in ""Three Kings,"" but are out of place in a film which takes place circa 200 A.D. Computer generated effects and matte shots are too obvious for a film of this caliber. Production design (Arthur Max, ""G.I. Jane"") and costume design (Janty Yates, ""Plunkett & Macleane"") are top notch (although they go a little overboard with a recreation of ""Triumph of the Will"" when Commodus reenters Rome as Emperor). Composer Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance), used so effectively in Crowe's previous film ""The Insider,"" disappoints here, giving us pretty Enya-like warbling unsuitable for this story.

""Gladiator"" gets kudos for attempting to give a fresh face to the genre but it's merely a good, not great, film."
10142,"ICE AGE","""Ice Age"" is a pleasure to look at and scarcely less fun as a story. I came to scoff and stayed to smile. I confess the premise did not inspire me: A woolly mammoth, a sabertooth tiger and a sloth team up to rescue a human baby and return it to its parents. Uh, huh. But Peter Ackerman's screenplay is sly and literate, and director Chris Wedge's visual style so distinctive and appealing that the movie seduced me.
The film takes place during a southward migration of species during a great ice age. Such migrations took place over millennia and were not the pre-Cambrian equivalent of going to Florida for the winter months, but no matter: As the ice packs advance, the animals retreat. There is no time to lose. Baby mammoths, playing in a tar pit, are told by their parents to hurry up: ""You can play Extinction later."" We meet Manfred the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo). Of course they can speak. (It is the humans, they believe, who have not yet mastered language.) When Sid and Manny come upon a small, helpless human child, they decide to protect it and return it to its parents--even though those same parents, they know, have developed weapons for killing them. Along the trail they are joined by Diego the Sabertooth (voiced by Denis Leary), who has a hidden agenda. They are potentially one another's dinners, and yet through Sid's insouciance and Manny's bravery in saving Diego from certain death, they bond and become friends.
It is true that altruism is a positive evolutionary trait; a species with individuals willing to die for the survival of the race is a species that will get somewhere in the Darwinian sweepstakes. But listen closely. When Diego the Sabertooth asks Manfred the Mammoth why he saved him, Manny replies, ""That's what you do as a herd."" Yes, absolutely. But herds are by definition made up of members of the same species (and tigers are not herd animals, anyway). If Manny's philosophy were to get around in the animal kingdom, evolution would break down, overpopulation would result, there would be starvation among the non-vegetarians, and it would be an ugly picture. Much of the serenity and order of nature depends on eating the neighbors.
""Ice Age"" does not preach Darwinian orthodoxy, however, but a kinder, gentler world view: Ice Age meets New Age. And the philosophy scarcely matters, anyway, since this is an animated comedy. Enormous advances have been made in animation technology in recent years, as computers have taken over the detail work and freed artists to realize their visions. But few movies have been as painterly as ""Ice Age,"" which begins with good choices of faces for the characters (note the sabertooth's underslung jaw and the sloth's outrigger eyes). The landscape is convincing without being realistic, the color palette is harmonious, the character movements include little twists, jiggles, hesitations and hops that create personality. And the animals blossom as personalities.
That's because of the artwork, the dialogue and the voice-over work by the actors; the filmmakers have all worked together to really see and love these characters, who are not ""cartoon animals"" but as quirky and individual as human actors, and more engaging than most.
I would suggest the story sneaks up and eventually wins us over, except it starts the winning process in its very first shots, showing a twitchy squirrel desperately trying to bury an acorn in an icy wilderness. We follow the progress of this squirrel all through the picture, as a counterpoint to the main action, and he is such a distinctive, amusing personality I predict he'll emerge as the hero of a film of his own."
