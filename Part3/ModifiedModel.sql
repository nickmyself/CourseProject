He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley\'s older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film\'s main visual elements would become features of Scott\'s later work; it was issued on the \'Extras\' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director.

Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki\'s films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine.\n\nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver\'s Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie\'s ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\nWhile Miyazaki\'s films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic\'s sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki\'s films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity\'s relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki\'s feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.[3] While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.','Tokyo'),(638,'Michael','NULL','Mann','1943-02-05','From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nMichael Kenneth Mann (born February 5, 1943) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer.

His siblings are Janine, Claire, Diane and Steven. His father was of Polish descent and worked as a nuclear physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In 1967 the Verbinski family moved to Southern California, where a young Gregor grew up in the town of La Jolla.\n\nGregor was an active Boy Scout and surfed regularly. He went to Torrey Pines Elementary, Muirlands Junior High, and La Jolla High School before attending UCLA Film School. Verbinski graduated with his BFA in Film from UCLA in 1987.\n\nVerbinski was active in several L.A. rock bands early in his career. His first band was Thelonius Monster, which included drummer Danny Heifetz. He also played in the Daredevils, Bulldozer, The Drivers, and the all-star band The Cylon Boys Choir.\n\nHe was also in a band called The Little Kings, which backed Stiv Bators on his version of \"Have Love Will Travel\". Along with a cover of the Moody Blues song \"The Story in Your Eyes\" (by other musicians), the song was released by Bators in the Fall of 1986 as a 12-inch single on Bomp! (catalogue #12136) and was later included in Bators\' compilation album L.A. L.A. On the compilation album\'s liner notes, label owner Greg Shaw described the band as \"an adequate but rootless Hollywood glam-damaged band with tattoos\".\n\nHis first films were a series of 8 mm films called \"The Driver Files\" circa 1979, when he was a young teen. Although most associate Verbinski with feature films, he started his career directing music videos for bands like Bad Religion, NOFX, 24-7 Spyz and Monster Magnet working at Palomar Pictures. This was not surprising to his friends in Los Angeles, since he had been in various punk and rock bands; the Daredevils, for instance, included then-departed member of Bad Religion Brett Gurewitz.\n\nVerbinski moved from music videos to commercials, where he worked for many brand names including Nike, Coca-Cola, Canon, Skittles and United Airlines. One of his most famous commercials was for Budweiser, featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in commercials, Verbinski won four Clio Awards and one Cannes Advertising Silver Lion.\n\nAfter completing a short film, The Ritual (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his feature film directing debut with his comedy flick, Mouse Hunt. The film was a hit globally and he soon followed up the success with the action/comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. The film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million domestically which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to its moderately low $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake The Ring (2002), which struck gold globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also had a directorial hand in The Time Machine that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted Simon Wells. Verbinski directed some of the underground Morlock sequences and is given a Thanks to credit in the film.\n\nHe then directed the very successful Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which earned over $600 million at the international box office.\n\nHis next film was The Weather Man which starred Nicolas Cage. The film received mixed to positive reviews but was a box office failure.\n\nIn March 2005 he started filming the sequels Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\'s Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\'s End. The former then became his biggest success so far, becoming the third film ever to gross over $1 billion at the international box office.\n\nHis future project will be an adaption of William Monahan\'s novel Light House: A Trifle, which is a story about an artist running away from the Mafia who hides in a lighthouse, in which kooky characters live. He will also direct Butterfly, about a man trying to drive his wife insane.\n\nVerbinski was also set to direct a film for Universal based on the video game, BioShock.  However he has since been replaced by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo as director, but he will still produce.

Wise\'s working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.\n\nOften contrasted with contemporary \"auteur\" directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial \"look\" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story to dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise\'s notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Through whatever means, Wise\'s approach would bring him critical success as a director in many different traditional film genres: from horror to noir to Western to war films to science fiction, to musical and drama, with many repeat hits within each genre. Wise\'s tendency towards professionalism led to a degree of preparedness which, though nominally motivated by studio budget constraints, nevertheless advanced the moviemaking art, with many Academy Award-winning films the result.

He epitomized the group of filmmakers known as the New Hollywood, which included George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Woody Allen and William Friedkin, who emerged in the early 1970s with unconventional ideas that challenged contemporary filmmaking. He co-authored the script for Patton, winning the Academy Award in 1970. His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards—for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d\'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival.

At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. Lee came from a proud and intelligent background. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature. He attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith\'s The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe\'s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee\'s next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She\'s Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million. Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring. Lee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie portrayed a neighborhood on a very hot day, and the racial tensions that emerge. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo\' Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington. His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee\'s handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee\'s next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March. His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994). He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. With pointed political messages, insightful, different and intelligent films, Spike Lee has become a well known political presence. He looks likely to have further success in the film business.

INSERT INTO `LONGREVIEW` VALUES (10113,'Star Trek: The Motion Picture ','A long time ago in a strange place called Hollywood, a theatrical cut of a movie was considered to be the director\'s cut. Now, with the advent of DVDs and the proliferation of special editions, numerous big-budget (and some not-so-big-budget) motion pictures are being given a second life in a format that is often quite different from the original version. For filmmakers who continuously like to tinker, this new philosophy is a godsend. They can release a truncated, studio-friendly version in theaters, then offer their \"true vision\" to DVD buyers.\n\nThis trend towards director\'s cuts/special editions was not started by George Lucas, but it was popularized by him. The financial windfall reaped when Lucas re-released the original three Star Wars films with new effects and footage awakened Hollywood executives to a previously-untapped resource. To be fair, most special editions exist primarily for creative reasons (although the studios backing them dream of $$$), and often result in a vastly improved product. James Cameron\'s The Abyss is a completely different movie - confusing and dissatisfying in the shortened theatrical version; sublime and brilliant in the director\'s cut. The hour added to Wolgang Petersen\'s Das Boot transforms it into a character-driven white-knuckler. Cameron Crowe\'s extended Almost Famous gives the story greater span and depth.\n\nIn 1979, the release of Star Trek - The Motion Picture represented the climax to every Star Trek fan\'s wet dream. The date, December 7, lived in infamy for the entire production crew. Paramount Pictures etched this date into their release calendar and informed everyone involved that the film would be ready on that day. Despite the Herculean effort by legendary director Robert Wise and his army of post-production assistants, the version of Star Trek - The Motion Picture that reached theaters was not complete. Effects scenes were unfinished, the sound mix was not perfected, and several important sequences were inexplicably left on the cutting room floor.\n\nThe movie that played in theaters during late 1979 and early 1980 received a mixed critical and popular reception. Star Trek fans were divided over the film. On one hand, it gave them the opportunity to spend time with characters who were as dear to them as old friends. On the other hand, it was largely a re-hash of previously-produced television episodes (in particular, \"The Changeling\"). The general public, expecting a Star Wars clone and instead getting something more sedate and less action-oriented, was bored. Two unflattering nicknames were born: Star Trek - The Motionless Picture and Star Trek - The Motion Sickness. The movie was a financial success, grossing nearly $90 million domestically (against a $35 million budget), but a large portion of that was contributed by Trekkers who returned time and time again to theaters to re-watch the movie. It was not unusual to find die-hards who would proudly claim to have seen Star Trek - The Motion Picture 40, 50, or even 100 times. (This kind of repeat business, unheard of in the era of home video, did occasionally happen.)\n\nThe film opens with the destruction of three Klingon warships by a mysterious energy cloud that is on a direct heading for Earth. The newly redesigned U.S.S. Enterprise, the pride and joy of the United Federation of Planets, is the only ship available to intercept the cloud, and it hasn\'t undergone its shakedown cruise. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), restless after 2 1/2 years behind a desk, uses the crises to once again take command of the Enterprise, forcing the ship\'s expected captain, Will Decker (Stephen Collins), into the role of Executive Officer. Most of the crew is re-united, including the irascible Dr. McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley) and the half-Vulcan Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy). Spock senses a kinship with the vast consciousness that exists at the heart of the cloud. Also on board are Chief Engineer Scotty (James Doohan), Security Chief Chekov (Walter Koenig), Helmsman Sulu (George Takei), Communications Officer Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and a newcomer, Navigator Ilia (Persis Khambatta).\n\nAfter battling several systems failures, including a malfunctioning transporter that kills two crewman and a propulsion system that becomes unstable and creates a wormhole, the Enterprise makes contact with the entity within the cloud, called V\'ger. The journey to the center of the alien ship is a strange and bizarre one. Ilia is killed when a probe invades the Enterprise bridge, and V\'ger later sends a second probe to the ship in the form of a mechanism that mimics Ilia\'s body and features. Kirk learns that V\'ger is a living machine traveling to Earth to make contact with its \"Creator\". If this contact is not made, V\'ger intends to wipe out all of the human beings \"infesting\" the planet. It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to prevent that eventuality.\n\nMy recollections of seeing Star Trek - The Motion Picture during its initial release are of watching a lot of pretty images pass across the screen. The special effects sequences seemed to go on forever, with only an occasional glimpse of the actors reacting to what their characters were supposedly seeing. Subsequent viewings on videotape enabled me to more clearly pinpoint the film\'s flaws - poor pacing and a reliance upon special effects over character development. The sterile atmosphere of the new Starship Enterprise had seemingly seeped into the movie\'s tone, which was cool and unfriendly.\n\nNow, more that 20 years later, Robert Wise has had the opportunity to return to the film and complete it in the manner he had originally envisioned. In addition to re-editing the movie, he was given the money to complete several effects sequences. The soundtrack was re-mixed and the picture was cleaned-up. The resultant product was released on DVD after consideration of a theatrical re-release was nixed. (A friend of mine who works for Paramount indicated that, had there been an actor\'s strike, Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director\'s Edition would have been in multiplexes some time during 2002, but, since the strike didn\'t happen, tentative plans for a theatrical launch were scrapped.)\n\nThe film\'s total running length has hardly changed, expanding by four minutes from 2:12 to 2:16. However, alterations to the Director\'s Edition represent more than just adding a few scenes. Some material was either removed or replaced (all of the deleted scenes and trims are available as part of the DVD\'s supplementary material). In total, about 10% of the film is different from the theatrical cut, but the changes, while seemingly slight, result in a significantly improved motion picture. Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director\'s Edition is no 2001 (its obvious inspiration - a fact that is more evident here than ever before), but it represents thought-provoking, well constructed science fiction.\n\nSo why is this version better than its theatrical sibling? The first, and most obvious, reason is that the pacing is better. Some of the new effects transform the V\'ger trip into a more involving experience, and the inclusion of several character-based scenes that were previously edited out (Spock weeping for V\'ger, Kirk ordering Scotty to prepare for a self-destruct) subtly shift the focus away from technical elements and back to the players. Wise\'s decisions about what to eliminate and what to add are inspired. The entire second act feels completely different. Secondly, the improved sound allows the audio to pack a punch that the original never did. And, finally, there\'s an intangible - because the movie explores ideas, it has aged better than many of its action-oriented contemporaries.\n\nThe \"idea\" aspect of Star Trek - The Motion Picture is enhanced in this version. The film spends more time exploring those unique qualities that make human beings special, and the importance of tempering logic and knowledge with emotion. Spock\'s breakthrough comes when he embraces his human half instead of rejecting it. For V\'ger to grow, it must find a way to move beyond the cold machine logic of its programming. To do that, V\'ger wants to \"join\" with its creator, and, in this, the film illuminates our need to strive for new goals and seek to attain the previously unattainable. And, while Star Trek - The Motion Picture doesn\'t answer the questions of \"Who am I? Why am I here?\", it isn\'t afraid to ask them.\n\nIt\'s interesting to note that the new special effects (produced by Foundation Imaging) - including an improved vision of Vulcan, a more impressive end to the wormhole sequence, our first view of the entire V\'ger ship from the outside, and a change in the approach \"walkway\" to V\'ger at the end - are done in such a manner that they blend seamlessly with the work done by Douglas Trumbell and John Dykstra 22 years ago. Nothing in Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director\'s Edition seems out of place. A casual viewer who hasn\'t seen the film in more than two decades might assume that little or nothing had changed.\n\nJerry Goldsmith\'s score, which has since become a staple in the Star Trek musical lexicon, represents one of the film\'s strengths. It\'s the music, as much as the visuals, that makes the shuttle\'s initial approach to the Enterprise such a majestic moment. The sequence is overlong, but the thrill of hearing Goldsmith\'s score allows us to enjoy the moment rather than fall asleep. The ominous, ethereal strains of his V\'ger themes enhance the sense that the Enterprise is penetrating ever deeper into a wondrous and dangerous realm as it moves deeper into the aliens\' vessel.\n\nWhen it comes to a Star Trek movie, the quality of acting is largely irrelevant. The familiar faces are all there doing pretty much what we expect them to do. William Shatner, ever the ham, applies his unique brand of overacting to Kirk, and we welcome it. (To be fair, Shatner is capable of giving a good performance as Kirk - something he does in Star Treks II, III, and VI.) Leonard Nimoy imbues Spock with a quiet dignity and DeForest Kelley slides easily into the part of the anti-technology old country doctor. The camaraderie between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, one of the strengths of the TV series, is in evidence here, although not to the extent that it could have been. As far as the newcomers are concerned, Stephen Collins is solid as Decker. However, while Persis Khambatta is striking to look at as the svelte, bald Ilia, this is not a memorable example of acting.\n\nRe-visiting Star Trek - The Motion Picture via this director\'s cut is like seeing a familiar story unfold in a new way. Wise\'s picture was an ambitious effort from the beginning, striving for a greatness that it never attained. In this new version, it still falls short, but not by as much. It has taken more than 20 years for Robert Wise to return to his chapter of the Star Trek saga and fulfill his vision. With no hesitation, I can say that it has been worth the wait. Star Trek - The Motion Picture: Director\'s Edition vaults this movie from a position as one of the weakest entries in the long-running film series to a perch as one of the strongest.'),(10114,'THE GODFATHER, PART III','\"The Godfather, Part III\" continues the Corleone family history in 1979, as the sins of the parents are visited upon the children. Despite every attempt to go legit, to become respectable, the past cannot be silenced. The family has amassed unimaginable wealth, and as the film opens Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is being invested with a great honor by the church. Later that day, at a reception, his daughter announces a Corleone family gift to the church and the charities of Sicily, \"a check in the amount of $100 million.\" But the Corleones are about to find, as others have throughout history, that you cannot buy forgiveness. Sure, you can do business with evil men inside the church, for all men are fallible and capable of sin. But God does not take payoffs.\nMichael is older now and walks with a stoop. He has a diabetic condition. He has spent the years since \"The Godfather, Part II\" trying to move the family out of crime and into legitimate businesses. He has turned over a lot of the old family rackets to a new generation, to people like Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who is not scrupulous about dealing dope, who is capable of making deals that would offend the fastidious Michael. It is Michael\'s dream, now that he senses his life is coming to a close, that he can move his family into the light.\nBut the past is seductive. Because Michael knows how to run a Mafia family, there is great pressure on him to do so. And throughout \"Godfather III\" we are aware of the essential tragedy of this man, the fact that the sins that stain his soul will not wash off - especially the sin of having ordered the death of his brother Fredo.\nMichael is positioned in the story between two characters who could come from \"King Lear\" - his daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), whom he loves and wants to give his kingdom to, and Sonny\'s son, Vincent (Andy Garcia), who sees the death of his enemies as the answer to every question. Michael is torn between the futures represented by the two characters, between Mary, quiet and naive, and the hot-blooded Vincent. And when Vincent seduces Mary and makes her his own, Michael\'s plans begin to go wrong.\nThere is also Kay Corleone (Diane Keaton), of course, still the woman Michael loves, and the mother of his children. He wants their son, Anthony, to join the family business. She defends his ambition to be an opera singer. They face each other like skilled opponents.\nPerhaps she even still loves him, too, or would if she did not know him so well. She is the only person who can tell Michael what she really thinks, and in one of those dark, gloomy rooms, she lets him know that it doesn\'t matter what grand order he is invested in by the church, he is at heart still a gangster. The best scenes in \"Godfather III\" are between these two, Michael and Kay, Pacino and Keaton, fiercely locked in a battle that began too many years ago, at that wedding feast where Michael told Kay he was not part of his family business.\nThe plot of the movie, concocted by Coppola and Mario Puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines, brings the Corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the Vatican. Actual events - the untimely suddenness of John Paul I\'s death, the scandals at the Vatican Bank, the body of a Vatican banker found hanging from a London bridge - are cheerfully intertwined with the Corleone\'s fictional story, and it is suggested that the Vatican lost hundreds of millions in a fraud. We eavesdrop on corrupt Vatican officials, venal cardinals scheming in the vast Renaissance palaces that dwarf them, and we travel to Sicily so that Michael Corleone can consult with Don Tommasino, his trusted old friend, to discover who is plotting against him within the Mafia council.\nThey are so seductive, these byzantine intrigues. Alliances are forged with a pragmatic decision, betrayed with sudden violence.\nAlways there is someone in a corner, whispering even more devious advice. This trait of operatic plotting and betrayal is practiced beautifully by Connie Corleone (Talia Shire), Michael\'s sister, who has turned in middle age into a fierce, thin-faced woman in black, who stands in the deepest shadows, who schemes and lobbies for her favorites - especially for Vincent, whom she wants Michael to accept and embrace.\nIn the \"Godfather\" movies Coppola has made a world. Because we know it so intimately, because its rhythms and values are instantly recognizable to us, a film like \"The Godfather Part III\" probably works better than it should. If you stand back and look at it rationally, this is a confusing and disjointed film. It is said that Coppola was rewriting it as he went along, and indeed it lacks the confident forward sweep of a film that knows where it\'s going.\nSome of the dialogue scenes, especially in the beginning, sound vaguely awkward; the answers do not fit the questions, and conversations seem to have been rewritten in the editing room. Other shots - long shots, into the light, so we cannot see the characters\' lips -- look suspiciously like scenes that were filmed first and dubbed later. The whole ambitious final movement of the film - in which two separate intrigues are intercut with the progress of an opera being sung by Anthony -- is intended to be suspenseful but is so confusing, we are not even sure which place (Sicily, Rome, London?) one of the intrigues is occurring. The final scene of the movie, which is intended to echo Marlon Brando\'s famous death scene, is perfunctory and awkward.\nAnd yet it\'s strange how the earlier movies fill in the gaps left by this one, and answer the questions. It is, I suspect, not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two, and yet, knowing them, \"Part III\" works better than it should, evokes the same sense of wasted greatness, of misdirected genius. Both Don Vito Corleone and Don Michael Corleone could have been great men. But they lacked that final shred of character that would have allowed them to break free from their own pasts. Or perhaps their tragedies were dictated by circumstances. Perhaps they were simply born into the wrong family.\nAnd so here we are back again, in the rich, deep brown rooms inhabited by the Corleone family, the rooms filled with shadows and memories, and regretful decisions that people may have to die. We have been taught this world so well by Francis Ford Coppola that we enter it effortlessly has there ever before been a film saga so seductive and compelling, so familiar to us that even after years we remember all of the names of the players? Here, for example, is a new character, introduced as \"Sonny\'s illegitimate son,\" and, yes, we nod like cousins at a family reunion, yes, he does seem a lot like Sonny.\nHe\'s the same kind of hotheaded, trigger-happy lunatic.'),(10115,'INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE','There is a certain style of illustration that appeared in the boys\' adventure magazines of the 1940s - in those innocent publications that have been replaced by magazines on punk lifestyles and movie monsters. The illustrations were always about the same. They showed a small group of swarthy men hovering over a treasure trove with greedy grins on their bearded faces, while in the foreground, two teenage boys peered out from behind a rock in wonder and astonishment. The point of view was always over the boys\' shoulders; the reader was invited to share this forbidden glimpse of the secret world of men.\n“Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” begins with just such a scene; director Steven Spielberg must have been paging through his old issues of Boys\' Life and Thrilling Wonder Tales, down in the basement.\nAs I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop.\nSpielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines. When the swarthy men bend over their discovery, it seems to glow with a light of its own, which bathes their faces in a golden glow. This is the kind of moment that can actually justify a line like It\'s mine! All mine! - although Spielberg does not go so far.\nOne of the two kids behind the boulder is, of course, the young Indiana Jones. But he is discovered by explorers plundering an ancient treasure, and escapes just in the nick of time. The sequence ends as an adult claps a battered fedora down on Indiana\'s head, and then we flash forward to the era of World War II.\nThe opening sequence of this third Indiana Jones movie is the only one that seems truly original - or perhaps I should say, it recycles images from 1940s pulps and serials that Spielberg has not borrowed before. The rest of the movie will not come as a surprise to students of Indiana Jones, but then how could it? The Jones movies by now have defined a familiar world of death-defying stunts, virtuoso chases, dry humor and the quest for impossible goals in unthinkable places.\nWhen “Raiders of the Lost Ark” appeared, it defined a new energy level for adventure movies; it was a delirious breakthrough. But there was no way for Spielberg to top himself, and perhaps it is just as well that “Last Crusade” will indeed be Indy\'s last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies.\nEven in this third adventure, some of the key elements are recycled from “Raiders.” This time, Indy\'s quest is to find the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus Christ is said to have used at the Last Supper.\n(To drink from the cup is to have eternal youth.) The Holy Grail reminds us of the Ark of the Covenant in the first film, and in both cases the chase is joined by Nazi villains.\nThe new element this time is how Spielberg fills in some of the past of the Jones character. We learn his real name (which I would not dream of revealing here), and we meet his father, Professor Henry Jones, who is played by Sean Connery on exactly the right note.\nLike the fathers of classic boys\' stories, Dr. Jones is not a parent so much as a grown-up ally, an older pal who lacks three dimensions because children are unable to see their parents in that complexity. I kept being reminded of the father in the Hardy Boys books, who shook his head and smiled at the exploits of his lovable lads and only rarely “expressed concern” or “cautioned them sternly.” Since the Hardy Boys were constantly involved, at a tender age, with an endless series of counterfeiters, car thieves, kidnap rings, Nazi spies and jewel thieves, their father\'s detachment seemed either saintly or mad - and Connery has fun with some of the same elements.\nHarrison Ford is Indiana Jones again this time, and what he does seems so easy, so deadpan, that few other actors could maintain such a straight and credible presence in the midst of such chaos. After young Indy discovers his life\'s mission in the early scenes, the central story takes place years later, when Dr. Jones (the world\'s leading expert on the Holy Grail) is kidnapped by desperados who are convinced he knows the secret of where it is now hidden.\nHe does. And Indy, working from his father\'s notebook, follows a trail from America to the watery catacombs beneath Venice, and then to the deserts of the Holy Land, where there is a sensational chase scene involving a gigantic Nazi armored tank.\nHe is accompanied on his mission by Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), an art historian he meets in Venice. But the character is a disappointment after the fire of Karen Allen in the first movie, and even the sultriness of Kate Capshaw in the second.\nSpielberg devises several elaborate set-pieces, of which I especially liked the rat-infested catacombs and sewers beneath Venice.\n(I tried not to remember that Venice, by definition, has no catacombs.) The art direction looks great in a scene involving a zeppelin, and an escape from the airship by airplane. And the great tank in the desert is fearsome and convincing.\nIf there is just a shade of disappointment after seeing this movie, it has to be because we will never again have the shock of this material seeming new. “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” now more than ever, seems a turning point in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was really no way Spielberg could make it new all over again.\nWhat he has done is to take many of the same elements, and apply all of his craft and sense of fun to make them work yet once again. And they do.'),(10116,'OCEAN\'S TWELVE','Just as most caper movies end with the thieves comfortably basking in retirement, so most sequels to caper movies begin with the thieves forced to go back to work and pull one more job. \"Ocean\'s Twelve\" does not disappoint. Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) is chatting on the phone with her husband Danny (George Clooney) when she looks out the window and says, \"Oh, no.\" Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is ringing the door bell.\nYou will recall that in \"Ocean\'s Eleven,\" Benedict was the owner of the Bellagio, a casino in Las Vegas from which the 11 stole -- well, let\'s see, with interest, it works out to about $19 million apiece. Benedict is accompanied on his visit by evil-looking twins and has a off-putting practice of poking people with a putter, the better to suggest dire consequences if his money is not returned. Yes, the insurance company has already paid off, but he envisions double indemnity.\nWith some movies, you begin to notice implausibilities. With others, you begin to admire them. For example, since Benedict eventually pays a personal call on each and every one of the original 11, why don\'t Danny and Tess simply telephone the other nine and warn them Benedict is coming? The reason you don\'t want to ask that question is because it would prevent the movie from introducing all the crooks and showing us what they\'re doing now.\nOne of the problems with a movie like this is directing traffic: How do you establish 11 characters (not counting Benedict, police inspector Catherine Zeta-Jones, rival thief Vincent Cassel, etc.) and keep them alive? You have a roll call every once in a while is what you do, or you have them thrown in jail so the camera can pan across their faces and remind us who they are. Occasionally you have a scene for no other reason than to get an actor\'s face on the screen for five seconds, so he will not be misplaced. Elliott Gould puffs on his cigar three different times for this very reason.\nThe movie takes inventory of its characters with the same droll wit it does everything else. The original original \"Ocean\'s 11,\" made in 1960 by the Rat Pack, was a send-up of 1950s caper movies (it was inspired by Jean-Pierre Melville\'s French classic \"Bob le Flambeur\"). The new original \"Ocean\'s Eleven\" (2001) was a successful attempt by Soderbergh to doodle with the formula, much as a pianist might pick out a tune just well enough to show he could play it if he wanted to. Now, with \"Ocean\'s Twelve,\" Soderbergh and his scenarists, George Clayton Johnson, Jack Golden Russell and George Nolfi, are doing a jazz riff. This isn\'t a caper movie at all, it\'s an improvisation on caper themes. If at times it seems like a caper, well, as the fellow said when he got up from the piano, it might not be Beethoven, but it has a lot of the same notes.\nWhat Soderbergh is working with here is the charm of his actors, particularly Clooney, Roberts, Brad Pitt and Jones, who have the key roles, and the puppy-dog earnestness of Matt Damon, who wakes up Pitt on a trans-Atlantic flight to tell him he thinks he\'s ready to play \"a more central role.\" Damon\'s character is named Linus, a good choice, since he is too sincere and intense to rise in Ocean\'s ironic universe. When one character is excoriated as agoraphobic (what a wonderful phrase that is, \"excoriated as agoraphobic,\" don\'t you think it\'s almost musical?), Linus earnestly argues, \"I don\'t think we have to be the kind of organization that labels people.\" There is a scene of mad invention in which Clooney and Pitt take him along for a meeting with Robbie Coltrane, an underworld contact, and their entire conversation is nonsense -- an exchange of elegantly meaningless paradoxes. Linus doesn\'t understand a word, which is reasonable, but what he doesn\'t realize is that they don\'t, either.\nTheir scheme has to do with stealing enough stuff to pay Benedict the $19 million apiece that they owe him. They doubt they can raise this much money in the two weeks until their deadline, especially since it appears that another thief, the Night Fox, is in business against them, and is either more skilled than they are, or a supernatural being. As they contemplate the security surrounding one of their targets, Pitt flatly states: \"In the physical universe we live in, it cannot be done.\" But the Night Fox can do it.\nOccasionally their plans take the long way around. Consider a man in Amsterdam who has sealed himself and his treasures inside a house guarded with multiple alarm systems and never leaves home. Surveillance indicates there is a control pad on an inner wall which might be manipulated to bypass the alarms. How to reach it? Their plan involves getting underneath the house, which is beside a canal and rests on underwater pylons, and using hydraulic lifts to raise the house one inch, so that a difficult shot with an arrow becomes possible. Uh, huh. With overhead like that, when do they reach their break-even point?\nRather than describe some of their other targets, such as a priceless jeweled egg, I will observe that all of the targets are MacGuffins, that it matters not what they go after but how they do it, and what they say in the process. The movie is all about behavior, dialogue, star power and wiseass in-jokes. I really sort of liked it.\nExample of the cleverness: There are two cameos in the movie that, for once, contribute something more than allowing us to say, \"Hey! There\'s (name of star)!\" The genius is that one of the stars is really there, and the other star is not really there, although she is there in the person of the character who seems to be her. This will all become clear when you see the movie. What I liked is that the one cameo role is used to expose the other cameo role. When you get to the point of interlocking cameos, you have ascended to a level of invention that is its own reward.'),(10117,'Gladiator','Gladiator is the kind of movie upon which Hollywood once built its reputation but rarely produces anymore: the spectacle. Filled with larger-than-life characters, gorgeous scenery, impressive set design, and epic storytelling, Gladiator is designed not just to entertain, but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. A boisterous reaction is expected every time the protagonist defies the odds and wins a conflict, or changes the tide of battle in his favor. This is filmmaking on a grand scale.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott made his name in movies by helming two acknowledged science fiction classics: Alien and Blade Runner. Aside from those films, however, his resume is littered with mediocre and unpromising titles, such as his most recent outing, G.I. Jane. (Some argue that Scott returned to form with 1991\'s overrated Thelma and Louise, but that\'s not an opinion I share.) Gladiator represents the British-born filmmaker\'s second attempt at an historical epic, and is far more successful than his previous endeavor, the stultifying 1492: Conquest of Paradise, which recounted Christopher Columbus\' arrival in the New World.\n\nGladiator is set in 180 AD, and uses actual historical personages and events for background. The events that transpire in the film are largely fictional, but they blend in well with the known facts. The Roman Empire is in full blossom, having survived the excesses of one corrupt emperor after the next. The latest Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a scholar who has taken to the battlefield to repel a barbarian threat from Germania. To that end, he has invaded, relying upon the leadership and valor of his best general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), to win the day. Maximus does not disappoint, and the Emperor privately decides to name him a his successor - a decision that does not sit well with Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Marcus\' son. In a fit of rage and grief, he kills his father, then has Maximus taken away to be executed. The general, however, escapes death, slaying his would-be killers, then races home to protect his wife and son. But he is too late - by the time he arrives, they are both dead, and he is soon taken prisoner by slave-traders. Along with his new friend Juba (Djimon Hounsou), he is bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed), an owner and trainer of Gladiators. Recognizing Maximus\' potential, Proximo grooms him for a trip to Rome\'s Coliseum.\n\nGladiator weds the heroic scope of movies like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Braveheart, and Rob Roy with the serpentine political treachery of I, Claudius. (A connection that is italicized by the presence of Claudius lead, Derek Jacobi, in the supporting role of a Roman Senator.) The film never fails to be involving and entertaining, and there are plenty of moments designed to stir the adrenaline. Additionally, the screenplay manages to avoid the trap of predictability. The villains are at least as smart as the heroes, and far more ruthless.\n\nFor New Zealand-born, Australian-bred actor Russell Crowe, Gladiator represents an opportunity to expand his reputation, which was heightened earlier this year by a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand in Michael Mann\'s The Insider. This is Crowe\'s first opportunity to carry a big-budget motion picture. The role of Maximus requires more presence than acting skill, and Crowe proves equal to the task. From films as diverse as Proof, Romper Stomper, and The Insider, we know he can act. Gladiator shows that he can dominate the screen with a cold stare, a clenched jaw, and a sure gait - attributes normally reserved for the likes of action mega-stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe supporting cast is comprised primarily of European notables. The exception is Joaquin Phoenix, whose Commodus is a conflicted-yet-detestable villain. Phoenix plays the character as a spoiled degenerate with effeminate mannerisms and huge appetites (historians mark the real Commodus as one of Rome\'s worst emperors). Yet, like a snake coiled and ready to strike, he is both unpredictable and dangerous. Connie Nielsen (who was one of the astronauts in Mission to Mars) is Commodus\' sister, who was once Maximus\' lover and whose 8-year old son is the current heir to Caesar\'s throne. Veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (in the final performance of a long career) all have significant screen time. And Djimon Hounsou, whose breakout role was as the lead in Amistad, plays Maximus\' brother-in-captivity.\n\nPerhaps Scott\'s greatest achievement with Gladiator is neither keeping the pacing of a 2 1/2 hour movie tight nor choreographing a spectacular battle scene, but creating a second-century Rome that is entirely credible and stunning in its detail. Ancient Rome is one of the most romanticized civilizations in the history of humanity, and rarely has it been brought to life with the grandeur of this film. The Coliseum, for example, has been resurrected to its full glory (largely through the use of digital technology). Gladiator consistently looks good, although, during some of the fights, rapid cutting creates a sense of disorientation and confusion.\n\nOne minor stumbling block for the film is an occasional tendency towards moments of pretension. One of Gladiator\'s themes is that power comes through controlling the mob. Successful gladiators are those who not only sate the crowd\'s desire for blood, but do so in an entertaining fashion. From time-to-time, a character will make a florid, preachy speech about this (or some other issue). We get snippets of dialogue like \"The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it\'s the sand of the Coliseum.\" (Delivered by Jacobi, the line sounds positively Shakespearean.) There\'s nothing wrong with injecting social commentary about the bestial nature of human beings into a movie like Gladiator - my argument is that it should be more subtle. But that\'s a minor quibble.\n\nLike many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. In this case, he is a slave taking on the most powerful man in the world - the Emperor of Rome. The ending may be a unlikely (although, from Commodus\' point-of-view, it could be a shrewd move if handled properly), but it is as exhilarating and satisfying as the final confrontation between Liam Neeson and Tim Roth in Rob Roy. As spectacles go, Gladiator has a great deal to recommend it. And, while the film has the ingredients to win over most audiences, it remains to be seen whether the marketing campaign and positive word-of-mouth will generate enough ticket sales for this cinematic combatant to remain strong when the field of early summer challengers becomes more difficult.\n\n'),(10118,'GLADIATOR','Maximus: I\'m required to kill--so I kill. That\'s enough.\nProximo: That\'s enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.\nA foolish choice in art direction casts a pall over Ridley Scott\'s \"Gladiator\" that no swordplay can cut through. The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct. Its colors are mud tones at the drab end of the palette, and it seems to have been filmed on grim and overcast days. This darkness and a lack of detail in the long shots helps obscure shabby special effects (the Colosseum in Rome looks like a model from a computer game), and the characters bring no cheer: They\'re bitter, vengeful, depressed. By the end of this long film, I would have traded any given gladiatorial victory for just one shot of blue skies. (There are blue skies in the hero\'s dreams of long-ago happiness, but that proves the point.) The story line is \"Rocky\" on downers. The hero, a general from Spain named Maximus (Russell Crowe), is a favorite of the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Maximus defeats the barbarians, Marcus names him protector of Rome. But he is left for dead by Marcus\' son, a bitter rival named Commodus (the name comes from the Latin for \"convenient\" and not what you\'re thinking).\nAfter escaping and finding that his wife and son have been murdered, Maximus finds his way to the deserts of North Africa, where he is sold as a slave to Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a manager of gladiators. When Commodus lifts his late father\'s ban on gladiators in Rome, in an attempt to distract the people from hunger and plagues, Maximus slashes his way to the top, and the movie ends, of course, with the Big Fight.\nThis same story could have been rousing entertainment; I have just revisited the wonderful \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" which is just as dimwitted but 12 times more fun. But \"Gladiator\" lacks joy. It employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if the characters are bitter and morose enough, we won\'t notice how dull they are.\nCommodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is one of those spoiled, self-indulgent, petulant Roman emperors made famous in the age of great Roman epics, which ended with \"Spartacus\" (1960). Watching him in his snits, I recalled Peter Ustinov\'s great Nero in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), collecting his tears for posterity in tiny crystal vials. Commodus has unusual vices even for a Caesar; he wants to become the lover of his older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), whose son he is bringing up as his heir.\nThe moral backbone of the story is easily mastered. Commodus wants to be a dictator, but is opposed by the senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi). The senators want him to provide sewers for the city\'s Greek district, where the plague is raging, but Commodus decides instead on a season of games. Proximo arrives with his seasoned gladiators from Africa, who prove nearly invincible and threaten the emperor\'s popularity. The moral lesson: It is good when gladiators slaughter everyone in sight, and then turn over power to the politicians.\nThe Colosseum productions play like professional wrestling. Events are staged to re-create famous battles, and after the visitors wipe out the home team, a puzzled Commodus tells his aide, \"My history\'s a little hazy--but shouldn\'t the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?\" Later, an announcer literally addresses the crowd in these words: \"Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion in Roman history--the legendary Titus!\" The battle sequences are a pale shadow of the lucidly choreographed swordplay in \"Rob Roy\" (1995); instead of moves we can follow and strategy we can appreciate, Scott goes for muddled closeups of fearsome but indistinct events. The crowd cheers, although those in the cheaper seats are impossible to see because of the murky special effects.\nWhen Maximus wins his first big fight, it\'s up to Commodus to decide whether he will live or die. \"Live! Live!\" the fans chant, and Commodus, bowing to their will, signals with a \"thumbs up.\" This demonstrates that Commodus was not paying attention in Caesar School, since the practice at the Colosseum at that time was to close the thumb in the fist to signal life; an extended thumb meant death. Luckily, no one else in the Colosseum knows this, either.\nCrowe is efficient as Maximus: bearded, taciturn, brooding. His closest friend among the gladiators is played by Djimon Hounsou, who played the passionate slave in \"Amistad.\" Since protocol requires him to speak less than Maximus, he mostly looks ferocious, effectively.\nNielsen shows the film\'s most depth, as the sister. Phoenix is passable as Commodus, but a quirkier actor could have had more fun in the role. Old pros Harris, Jacobi and Reed are reliable; Scott does some fancy editing and a little digital work to fill the gaps left when Reed died during the production.\n\"Gladiator\" is being hailed by those with short memories as the equal of \"Spartacus\" and \"Ben-Hur.\" This is more like \"Spartacus Lite.\" Or dark. It\'s only necessary to think back a few months, to Julie Taymor\'s \"Titus,\" for a film set in ancient Rome that\'s immeasurably better to look at. The visual accomplishment of \"Titus\" shames \"Gladiator,\" and its story is a whole heck of a lot better than the \"Gladiator\" screenplay, even if Shakespeare didn\'t make his Titus the only undefeated champion in Roman history.'),(10119,'Ocean\'s Twelve','Pleasantness and affability reign supreme in Steven Soderbergh\'s sequel to the remake of Ocean\'s Eleven. This time around, even the bad guys don\'t seem so bad. Rumor has it that the atmosphere on the set of Ocean\'s Twelve was so easy-going that it was more like summer camp than a movie shoot, and much of the sense of fun comes across on screen. Everyone who survived the first film is back for the second, including the entire complement of \"Ocean\'s Eleven.\" There are two high-profile newcomers. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Europol agent Isabel Lahiri, an ex-flame of Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who is the confidante of Danny Ocean (George Clooney). The there\'s Vincent Cassel, who portrays \"The Night Fox,\" a rival thief who believes that Ocean\'s reputation is inflated - a fact he intends to prove by challenging his rival to a thieving competition.\n\nWhen the film opens, Danny is retired and living in marital bliss with his wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). It\'s their \"second third\" anniversary, and Danny\'s life is about to go to hell. Someone has tipped off Casino honcho Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) about the location of Danny and his ten friends, and they all receive an ultimatum: pay back $160 million (plus interest) in two weeks or face the consequences. So it\'s off to Europe for Ocean\'s Eleven (they\'re too notorious to be able to pull any heists stateside), where they have to steal enough money in 12 days to be able to fulfill their obligation to Benedict.\n\nDespite being overlong (does any caper comedy need to eat up more than two hours?), Ocean\'s Twelve is enjoyable, and will likely appeal to anyone who appreciated the 2001 film. Not only are the actors the same, but the men behind the scenes, including Soderbergh, producer Jerry Weintraub, and composer David Holmes, have returned for another round. The screenplay, by George Nolfi, starts out a little slow, but, by the end of the first hour, it has hit its stride with the movie building momentum. The complicated details of the final heist are entertaining to unravel, and there\'s also a wonderfully wry bit of fourth wall-breaking fun that Soderbergh has at Julia Roberts\' expense. Some might consider this to be too cute, but, from my perspective, it\'s ballsy.\n\nWith a cast of this size, it\'s expected that some of the performers will be featured far more than others. This time around, Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner have the least screen time. The latter spends most of the time out of the game while the former cools his heels in prison for two-thirds of the film. While there\'s plenty of opportunity for Roberts, Clooney, and Matt Damon to say lines and interact, the real \"star\" (if there can be said to be one) is Brad Pitt. There\'s a fair amount of smoldering chemistry between Rusty and Isabel, which is as much due to Zeta-Jones as to Pitt. Despite being new to this series, Isabel has the fullest \"character moments\" of any of the baker\'s dozen.\n\nAlthough it functions adequately as a heist movie, Ocean\'s Twelve fairs better when seen through the lens of a comedy. The screenplay offers a lot of breezy dialogue, and, while it never gets overly silly, it\'s clear that we\'re not meant to take any of the proceedings seriously. (The business with Julia Roberts makes that abundantly clear.) There is a \"surprise\" cameo at the end, although astute viewers can figure out long before the moment of the \"big reveal\" whom Soderbergh\'s veteran player is (I\'m not talking about Bruce Willis). And, as must always be the case with any movie involving planned criminal activities, there are plenty of twists, including the expected final one.\n\nIf there\'s a difference between Ocean\'s Eleven and Ocean\'s Twelve, it\'s the involvement of Mr. Murphy. In the first film, not all that much went wrong. This time around, however, Murphy\'s Law strikes with a vengeance. Danny and his friends get to learn first hand the truth in the saying, \"The best laid plans of mice and men...\" In the end, however, it will come as no big surprise to learn that everything isn\'t as straightforward as it initially appears.\n\nSoderbergh peppers the print with occasional directorial flourishes (freeze-frames, the use of colored filters, etc.), but, for the most part, he presents the film \"straight.\" And, on those occasions when he shows off, it\'s neither prolonged nor extreme enough to become distracting. One could make an argument that the filmmaker isn\'t so much directing his actors as he is shepherding them through the movie-making process. There\'s a sense that at least some of the dialogue was improvised. The final result speaks well for the process, whatever it actually was. Ocean\'s Twelve represents a lively way to spend a December evening.'),(10120,'SPIRITED AWAY','\"Miyazaki\'s Spirited Away\" has been compared to \"Alice in Wonderland,\" and indeed it tells of a 10-year-old girl who wanders into a world of strange creatures and illogical rules. But it\'s enchanting and delightful in its own way, and has a good heart. It is the best animated film of recent years, the latest work by Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese master who is a god to the Disney animators.\nBecause many adults have an irrational reluctance to see an animated film from Japan (or anywhere else), I begin with reassurances: It has been flawlessly dubbed into English by John Lasseter (\"Toy Story\"), it was co-winner of this year\'s Berlin Film Festival against \"regular\" movies, it passed \"Titanic\" to become the top-grossing film in Japanese history, and it is the first film ever to make more than $200 million before opening in America.\nI feel like I\'m giving a pitch on an infomercial, but I make these points because I come bearing news: This is a wonderful film. Don\'t avoid it because of what you think you know about animation from Japan. And if you only go to Disney animation--well, this is being released by Disney.\nMiyazaki\'s works (\"My Neighbor Totoro,\" \"Kiki\'s Delivery Service,\" \"Princess Mononoke\") have a depth and complexity often missing in American animation. Not fond of computers, he draws thousand of frames himself, and there is a painterly richness in his work. He\'s famous for throwaway details at the edges of the screen (animation is so painstaking that few animators draw more than is necessary). And he permits himself silences and contemplation, providing punctuation for the exuberant action and the lovable or sometimes grotesque characters.\n\"Spirited Away\" is told through the eyes of Chihiro (voice by Daveigh Chase), a 10-year-old girl, and is more personal, less epic, than \"Princess Mononoke.\" As the story opens, she\'s on a trip with her parents, and her father unwisely takes the family to explore a mysterious tunnel in the woods. On the other side is what he speculates is an old theme park; but the food stalls still seem to be functioning, and as Chihiro\'s parents settle down for a free meal, she wanders away and comes upon the film\'s version of wonderland, which is a towering bathhouse.\nA boy named Haku appears as her guide, and warns her that the sorceress who runs the bathhouse, named Yubaba, will try to steal her name and thus her identity. Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette) is an old crone with a huge face; she looks a little like a Toby mug, and dotes on a grotesquely huge baby named Boh. Ominously, she renames Chihiro, who wanders through the structure, which is populated, like \"Totoro,\" with little balls of dust that scurry and scamper underfoot.\nIn the innards of the structure, Chihiro comes upon the boiler room, operated by a man named Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers), who is dressed in a formal coat and has eight limbs, which he employs in a bewildering variety of ways. At first he seems as fearsome as the world he occupies, but he has a good side, is no friend of Yubaba, and perceives Chihiro\'s goodness.\nIf Yubaba is the scariest of the characters and Kamaji the most intriguing, Okutaresama is the one with the most urgent message. He is the spirit of the river, and his body has absorbed the junk, waste and sludge that has been thrown into it over the years. At one point, he actually yields up a discarded bicycle. I was reminded of a throwaway detail in \"My Neighbor Totoro,\" where a child looks into a bubbling brook, and there is a discarded bottle at the bottom. No point is made; none needs to be made.\nJapanese myths often use shape-shifting, in which bodies reveal themselves as facades concealing a deeper reality. It\'s as if animation was invented for shape-shifting, and Miyazaki does wondrous things with the characters here. Most alarming for Chihiro, she finds that her parents have turned into pigs after gobbling up the free lunch. Okutaresama reveals its true nature after being freed of decades of sludge and discarded household items. Haku is much more than he seems. Indeed the entire bathhouse seems to be under spells affected the appearance and nature of its inhabitants.\nMiyazaki\'s drawing style, which descends from the classical Japanese graphic artists, is a pleasure to regard, with its subtle use of colors, clear lines, rich detail and its realistic depiction of fantastical elements. He suggests not just the appearances of his characters, but their natures. Apart from the stories and dialogue, \"Spirited Away\" is a pleasure to regard just for itself. This is one of the year\'s best films.\n'),(10121,'LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS','With \"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,\" it\'s clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien.\nThe task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. \"The Two Towers\" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\" It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there.\n\"The Two Towers\" is a rousing adventure, a skillful marriage of special effects and computer animation, and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty. It also gives us, in a character named the Gollum, one of the most engaging and convincing CGI creatures I\'ve seen. The Gollum was long in possession of the Ring, now entrusted to Frodo, and misses it (\"my precious\") most painfully; but he has a split personality and (in between spells when his dark side takes over) serves as a guide and companion for Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin). His body language is a choreography of ingratiation and distortion.\nThe film introduces another computer-generated character, Treebeard, a member of the most ancient race in Middle-Earth, a tree that walks and talks and takes a very long time to make up its mind, explaining to Merry and Pippin that slowness is a virtue. I would have guessed that a walking, talking tree would look silly and break the spell of the movie, but no, there is a certain majesty in this mossy old creature.\nThe film opens with a brief reprise of the great battle between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Balrog, the monster made of fire and smoke, and is faithful to the ancient tradition of movie serials by showing us that victory is snatched from certain death, as Gandalf extinguishes the creature and becomes in the process Gandalf the White.\nTo compress the labyrinthine story into a sentence or two, the enemy is Saruman (Christopher Lee), who commands a vast army of Uruk-Hai warriors against the fortress of Theoden (Bernard Hill). Aragorn joins bravely in the fray, but the real heroes are the computer effects, which create the castle, landscape, armies and most of the action.\nThere are long stretches of \"The Two Towers\" in which we are looking at mostly animation on the screen. When Aragorn and his comrades launch an attack down a narrow fortress bridge, we know that the figures toppling to their doom are computer-generated, along with everything else on the screen, and yet the impact of the action is undeniable. Peter Jackson, like some of the great silent directors, is unafraid to use his entire screen, to present images of wide scope and great complexity. He paints in the corners.\nWhat one misses in the thrills of these epic splendors is much depth in the characters. All of the major figures are sketched with an attribute or two, and then defined by their actions. Frodo, the nominal hero, spends much of his time peering over and around things, watching others decide his fate, and occasionally gazing significantly upon the Ring. Sam is his loyal sidekick on the sidelines. Merry and Pippin spend a climactic stretch of the movie riding in Treebeard\'s branches and looking goggle-eyed at everything, like children carried on their father\'s shoulders. The fellowship of the first movie has been divided into three during this one, and most of the action centers on Aragorn, who operates within the tradition of Viking swordsmen and medieval knights.\nThe details of the story--who is who, and why, and what their histories and attributes are--still remains somewhat murky to me. I know the general outlines and I boned up by rewatching the first film on DVD the night before seeing the second, and yet I am in awe of the true students of the Ring. For the amateur viewer, which is to say for most of us, the appeal of the movies is in the visuals. Here there be vast caverns and mighty towers, dwarves and elves and Orcs and the aforementioned Uruk-Hai (who look like distant cousins of the aliens in \"Battlefield Earth\"). And all are set within Jackson\'s ambitious canvas and backdropped by spectacular New Zealand scenery.\n\"The Two Towers\" will possibly be more popular than the first film, more of an audience-pleaser, but hasn\'t Jackson lost the original purpose of the story somewhere along the way? He has taken an enchanting and unique work of literature and retold it in the terms of the modern action picture. If Tolkien had wanted to write about a race of supermen, he would have written a Middle-Earth version of \"Conan the Barbarian.\" But no. He told a tale in which modest little hobbits were the heroes. And now Jackson has steered the story into the action mainstream. To do what he has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver.'),(10122,'Pirates of the Caribbean\': Eat My Jetsam, Davy Jon','AT first glance, it seems like a pretty good deal. You put down your money — still less than $10 in most cities — and in return you get two and a half hours of spirited swashbuckling, with an all-star three-way battle of the cheekbones (Orlando Bloom vs. Keira Knightley vs. Johnny Depp) and some extra-slimy computer-generated imagery thrown in at no additional cost. But there\'s a catch, as there usually is. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\'s Chest\" is not just a movie. It\'s a glistening, sushi-grade chunk of franchise entertainment, which means that maximal enjoyment of it comes with certain obligations. It is the second episode in what will be at least a trilogy — the third installment is scheduled for release next summer — and full appreciation of its whirligig plot will depend on thorough acquaintance with the first \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" picture, conveniently available for purchase on DVD. And since \"Dead Man\'s Chest\" brazenly dispenses with the convention of an ending — it\'s pretty much all middle — you will, by virtue of buying that ticket, have committed yourself to buying another one a year from now if you\'re the least bit curious about how the whole thing turns out. By then, chances are good that you will have forgotten most of what happened in \"Dead Man\'s Chest,\" so you\'ll have another disc to add to the shopping cart.  The question is: Is it worth it? The same thought probably crosses the minds of Disney theme-park vacationers as they endure endless lines for the ride on which the movies are based, but the notion is quickly banished because nobody likes to feel like a sucker. By a rational calculation of time and money — yours and the untold millions invested by Disney, the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and others — the answer is probably no. But hey, this isn\'t about that, right? It\'s about fun. You\'re there to have fun. Fun for the family. Fun for the kids. Fun for everyone. So shut up and have fun.  And you probably will, even if it\'s hard to shake the feeling that you\'ve been bullied into it. Gore Verbinski, the director, has an appropriate sense of mischief, as a well as a gift, nearly equaling those of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, for integrating CGI seamlessly into his cinematic compositions. What is curious about the recent crop of high-tech blockbusters is how seriously they take themselves, and unlike, say, \"Superman Returns,\" \"Dead Man\'s Chest\" cannot be called pretentious. It makes no claims to being about good and evil, the difficulty of saving the world in the modern era, or the inner lives of any of its characters.  Instead, it sends Elizabeth Swann (Ms. Knightley) and Will Turner (Mr. Bloom), their wedding day ruined in an opening sequence that seems to pay tribute to the old Guns N\' Roses \"November Rain\" video, on a search for the pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Mr. Depp). Jack, as usual, finds himself in all kinds of trouble, pursued not only by agents of the British crown, but also by an undead, squid-faced mariner, the famous Davy Jones, who commands a ghoulish crew of half-human, half-aquatic creatures. These sailors are like the cast of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" — or the menu at a seafood restaurant —come to life: Night of the Living Bouillabaisse.  One of them, played by Stellan Skarsgard with a starfish embedded in his face, is Will\'s long-lost father, a development that adds a gelatinous morsel of father-son pathos to the stew of plots and subplots cooked up by the screenwriters, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Davy Jones himself, meanwhile, speaks in the sinister whisper of Bill Nighy, though it is his swaying mass of facial tentacles that most viewers will remember.  And there are other memorable bits and pieces, visual highlights of a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. Ms. Knightley is, once again, a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end. Mr. Bloom, as is his custom, leaps about, trying to overcome his incurable blandness, and is upstaged by special effects, musical cues, octopus tentacles and pieces of wood. Naomie Harris turns up for a few scenes of hammy voodoo, and Mackenzie Crook and David Bailie contribute some proletarian slapstick. Most of the other members of the first movie\'s cast show up again, sometimes in surprising circumstances.  The franchise, of course, belongs to Jack Sparrow, and to Mr. Depp. Because this is a sequel, the role is no longer the splendid surprise it was in 2003, when \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" charmed audiences and disarmed critics on its way to the third-best domestic box-office gross of the year. But the best parts of \"Dead Man\'s Chest\" confirm Jack Sparrow as the most viable Disney cartoon character in quite some time, though his anarchic insouciance has more in common with the work of Chuck Jones or Tex Avery. Mr. Verbinski, for his part, grasps the kinship between today\'s computer-assisted filmmaking and the hand-drawn animation of old, which lies in the freedom to revise the laws of physics at will. Two sequences in particular stand out, and would stand alone nicely as shorts: I will always think of them as \"Fruit Kebab\" and \"Runaway Hamster Wheel.\"  But the easy delight that such flights of visual fancy inspires is crowded and blocked by all the other stuff going on in this long, ungainly movie, which for all its busy, buzzing parts, is incapable of standing on its own. It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over. By next summer, I suppose, we\'ll all be rested and ready for more.'),(10123,'Star Trek the Motion Picture (1979)\nThe Screen: \'S','\"Star Trek,\" the popular television series that died 10 years ago but would not be forgotten, has, like Lazarus, come back to haunt the skeptical and reassure all those who have kept the faith. It\'s called \"Star Trek — the Motion Picture,\" rather superfluously, I think, because I doubt anyone who sees it could possibly confuse this film with those shards of an earlier, simpler, cheaper television era.\n\nWatching \"Star Trek — the Motion Picture,\" which opens today at Loews Orpheum and other theaters, is like attending your high-school class\'s 10th reunion at Caesar\'s Palace. Most of the faces are familiar, but the décor has little relationship to anything you\'ve ever seen before. Among the friends are good old Captain Kirk (William Shatner), commanding officer of the Starship Enterprise; pointy-eared Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), whose humanity disqualifies him from attaining \"kolinahr,\" the state of grace on his native planet Vulcan; Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), the spaceship\'s general practitioner, nicknamed \"Bones,\" just as he might have been on H.M.S. Bounty, and such other reliables as Scotty (James Doohan), the engineering officer, and Sulu (George Takei), the ship\'s helmsman.\n\nThe newcomers are Stephen Collins, who plays Commander Decker, the Enterprise\'s stalwart young executive officer, and Perris Khambatta, an actress from India who plays Ilia, a shockingly beautiful young woman whose head has been shaved as clean as a whistle in the fashion of her home-planet, Delta Four.\n\nThis time out the mission of the Enterprise is to intercept a mysterious cloud, which is apparently light years in diameter and is heading toward earth for reasons that not even Mr. Spock can divine. It\'s not revealing a secret to tell you that the cloud contains what is usually referred to under such circumstances as \"a superior intelligence,\" though just what that intelligence is must remain one of the film\'s few witty surprises.\n\nI suspect that wit is not what \"Star Trek\" fans are looking for. Instead they want to see favorite characters who are as ageless and multidimensional as characters in a comic strip, and not at all ashamed of those origins. The dialogue — at least what dialogue one can hear over Jerry Goldsmith\'s music and the sounds of rockets being fired — is of a banality that soothes the weary mind, like Magic Fingers that work on a tired brain. Unlike \"Star Wars,\" which was full of conscious associations to other literature, \"Star Trek\" refers only to itself, with the possible exception of the climactic sequence that borrows freely from Christian myth.\n\nThe film\'s vision of the future, which is a bit tacky at the beginning, becomes increasingly hypnotic as the movie goes on, or maybe it just seems that way as one falls under the spell of so many abstract patterns of light and color, designed to simulate the experiences of the members of the Enterprise crew as they pass through various dimensions of time and space.\n\n\"Star Trek\" is yet another film that owes more to Douglas Trumbull and John Dykstra, who did the special photographic effects, and to Harold Michelson, the production designer, than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer, Gene Roddenberry, who also created and produced the television series.\n\nThe formidable Robert Wise, who once directed a good, pacifist sci-fi film, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), a film with very few special effects, directed \"Star Trek,\" but I can\'t imagine what there was for him to do after telling the actors where to stand. Because most of the drama in such a movie is created in the laboratories, the actors are limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief.\n\n'),(10124,'GODFATHER','I remember watching one of those cable TV documentaries a few years back about gangsters and the narrator remarking that by the early seventies real-life Mafiosi had lost touch with any sense of pride in their dubious heritage. Then \"The Godfather\" came along, and many of the younger crowd of hoods began imitating what they saw on the screen. You don\'t think the \"Dapper Don\" just happened, do you? The clothing, the style, even some of the talk was copied from the movie. Art imitating life and, in return, life imitating art. The circle goes round and round.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola\'s 1972 classic, \"The Godfather,\" is to gangster films what Cecil B. DeMille\'s \"The Ten Commandments\" is to super spectaculars. It\'s among the grandest of the lot in scope and vision, a film eclipsed in this regard only by Coppola\'s own 1974 sequel, \"The Godfather, Part II.\" Yet \"The Godfather\" tells a uniquely personal story that places it in a league of its own. It\'s no wonder, then, that the American Film Institute voted it their third best American film in history or that it is sometimes even considered THE best, as \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised it in their book, \"The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.\" It would be over a dozen years before Coppola attempted a third installment in the series with 1990\'s \"The Godfather, Part III,\" which didn\'t quite live up to expectations but turned out to be a pretty good movie, anyway. Why the \"Godfather\" films (or \"Citizen Kane\" for that matter) had to wait so long to see the light of silver disc is anybody\'s guess, but here they are, \"Godfathers I, II, and III,\" looking better than we\'ve ever seen them before in the home, packaged together in a grand, five-disc boxed set that also includes a whole mob of extra materials. \"The Godfather Collection\" is a little pricey, but it\'s required viewing for motion-picture buffs, gangster-movie buffs, home-theater buffs, and just about anybody else who values good filmmaking.\n\n\"The Godfather,\" as you know, actually chronicles the life and times of two fictional godfathers of crime, Don Vito (Marlon Brando), the old man and patriarch of the Corleone family, and his son Michael (Al Pacino), who eventually inherits the mantle of Boss. Based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo, the story begins in 1945, at the close of the Second World War, at the wedding of the old Don\'s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Coppola has a wonderful eye for detail, and the wedding reception is as good an introduction as any to the big Sicilian family that would dominate all three \"Godfather\" films. But it\'s when Coppola takes us into the Corleone home during the festivities that we get to see what\'s really up; the family may be in the midst of celebration, but business goes on as usual as supplicants come to do homage to the powerful Don and ask favors of him. We\'re also introduced here to son Michael, a returning War hero; his fiancee, Kay (Diane Keaton); his older, stormier brother, Sonny (James Caan); and his other, weaker brother, Fredo (John Cazale); along with family associates Clemenza (Richard Castellano), Tessio (Abe Vigoda), Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), and consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). Plus, we meet Al Martino as pop singer Johnny Fontaine (supposedly patterned after Frank Sinatra) and Richard Conte as a powerful rival, Don Barzini. Later, we meet Sterling Hayden as a crooked cop named McCluskey; John Marley as a Hollywood mogul, Jack Woltz; and Al Lettieri as a ruthless henchman, Sollozzo.\n\nInterestingly, it\'s been said that in order for the first \"Godfather\" film to be made in New York, Coppola had to agree not to use the words \"Mafia\" or \"Cosa Nostra\" anywhere in it. Otherwise, there may have been some interference with the production by the New York \"families.\" Apparently, the mob liked what they eventually saw. Coppola initially wanted Sir Laurence Olivier to play Don Vito Corleone, but novelist Puzo wanted Brando, and Brando won out, thanks to his own eager desire to play the role and despite Paramount\'s less-than-enthusiastic appraisal of the idea. Brando later said he tried to imitate gangster Frank Costello\'s voice in the movie, but he had to redub some of his dialogue because it was so hard to understand. The film eventually won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Screenplay Adaptation.\n\nThanks to the enormous success of \"The Godfather,\" Paramount gave Coppola more money and a freer hand in directing the sequel, \"The Godfather, Part II.\" Using a broader canvas, Coppola provides not one but two stories in the longest of the three \"Godfather\" movies. Not only do we get to see Michael\'s consolidation of strength as new head of the Mob family, we get to see how it all started in flashbacks to a young Vito Corleone\'s rise from poverty to power during the early part of the twentieth century. For me, these are the best parts of the picture, providing an epic landscape of events and an exquisite tapestry of characterizations.\n\nEveryone assumed Brando would again star in the sequel, but he said he had done the first film as a social comment on American corporate power and had no interest in doing another. The fact that Paramount still didn\'t want much to do with the tempestuous Brando probably added to his turning down the role. So, Coppola worked around him, filming the few scenes in which the older Don Corleone is supposed to be present with the Don out of the room! Fortunately, the rest of the cast was to shine with even greater brilliance. Actor\'s Studio director and \"method\" advocate Lee Strasberg made his screen debut as Hyman Roth, the money man of the mob families, a part patterned on real-life gangster Meyer Lansky. And, of course, Robert De Niro was tapped to play the younger Don Vito, a milestone in the actor\'s career. This second film garnered twice the Academy Awards of its predecessor, again for Best Picture, and this time also for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (De Niro), Best Screenplay, Best Score, and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration. By the way, if the Corleone estate at Lake Tahoe looks impressive, it should be; it was the property of former industrialist Henry J. Kaiser.\n\nBy the time \"The Godfather, Part III\" was released in 1990, public interest in gangster films was beginning to wane. In any case, the movie fell short of its progenitors in critical appraisal and box-office receipts. Reviews of the day tended to point fingers at Coppola\'s decision to cast his own daughter, Sofia, in the major role of the Pacino character\'s daughter. Ms. Coppola had done little or no acting in films previously and was thought by many critics to detract from the overall high standards of the production. Frankly, I don\'t think many people among the general public even noticed her lack of theatrical experience, and, in fact, she carries off her part with a sweet naiveté that is fully in accord with her film character. No, I rather suspect that the third film\'s lackluster performance can be attributed more to the fact that it\'s overly complicated and hard to follow and that most of the Corleone family we had come to know (and dare I say \"love\"?) had been killed off or disappeared by this time. After all, Brando was gone and De Niro and Robert Duvall and James Caan and Richard Castellano. Only Pacino, Shire, and Keaton were still in evidence, looking much older and more careworn than in the earlier pictures. Nevertheless, the introduction of Sonny\'s hotheaded son, Vincent (Andy Garcia), is inspired, and the movie has a polished grandeur about it that\'s hard to deny, especially in the famous closing moments during Coppola\'s poetic intercuts between opera hall and murder plot. \"The Godfather, Part III\" was nominated for seven Academy Awards but won none. The nominations were for Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Andy Garcia), Cinematography (Gordon Willis), Song (Carmine Coppola, music, and John Bettis, lyrics), Art Direction, and Film Editing.\n\nVideo:\nParamount released all three films theatrically in a 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, reproduced here in anamorphic widescreen. The colors, predominantly brown earth hues, burnished golds, and shadowy blacks and tans, are naturally reproduced, if a bit on the soft side. However, since this is the way I remember the images looking on the motion-picture screen, I\'d guess the DVD transfers are probably fairly accurate, although time seems to have faded the colors somewhat and added a touch of noise. \"The Godfather, Part II,\" the longest of the movies, is spread out over two discs for maximum picture and sound quality, but the first \"Godfather\" film, surprisingly, seemed to me to have the sharpest definition and clarity of the lot; maybe I was just imagining things. I noticed some moiré effects in all three films and some moments of moderate grain and noise, the latter again perhaps due to the effects of time.\n\nAudio:\nThe present Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mixes for the three films are a varied batch, spanning as they do nearly a twenty-year period. All of them convey smooth, natural voice properties and a reasonably wide dynamic range that render dialogue and effects realistically. However, they differ considerably in their ability to convey front and rear-channel information, the first of the films having an especially constricted stereo spread and very little surround sound. This should not come as a surprise. Although multi-channel stereo had been around in movies since the fifties (discounting \"Fantasia\"), stereo was not widely utilized theatrically for many years thereafter, with many filmmakers either ignoring stereo or limiting its use, as was the case with the first \"Godfather\" entry. But by \"Godfather, Part II\" the sound opens up a bit more, Nino Rota\'s musical score in particular, and by the final installment in the series the sound appears even wider, more dynamic, and more ambient. The 5.1 remixes do their job.\n\nExtras:\nAs for added-value items, there\'s a gang of them. Probably of most importance are the audio commentaries on each of the films by director Francis Ford Coppola. I liked the fact that he notices mistakes in the filming and isn\'t shy or embarrassed about pointing them out to the viewer, like, for example, the extras who were out of place in certain shots. But as he says, if audiences didn\'t notice or didn\'t care, neither did he. He provides a wealth of such details, even remarking on his battle with Paramount over the inclusion of Rota\'s famous music. Seems Paramount didn\'t like it, and Coppola did. The director threatened to risk being fired if he didn\'t get his way. He got his way. \n\nNext, there\'s a fifth, bonus disc in the box, which is neatly indexed for subject matter. The first item of interest on it is a seventy-three minute documentary called \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\" that takes us behind the scenes. It\'s comprised of interviews and clips from around 1970 through 1991. It\'s a genuinely informative work of filmmaking and not a mere fluff piece. Coppola calls \"The Godfather\" the \"biggest home movie in history.\" This is accompanied by a recent seven-minute featurette, \"On Location,\" detailing the locales of the first two films. Then, there are an amazing thirty-four additional scenes that had to be cut from the movies, each with its own introduction and each following a timeline in sequence. Some of the deleted material is in widescreen, some in full-frame, all of it is fascinating. In addition, the bonus disc brings us footage of the various Academy Award acceptance speeches for the films; Francis Coppola\'s notebook, a ten-minute narration; and a valuable Corleone family tree to help us keep track of all the characters in the movies. Finally, there are segments on Gordon Willis\'s cinematography, Nino Rota\'s and Carmine Coppola\'s music, Coppola and Mario Puzo\'s screenplays, plus the usual assortment of storyboards, photo galleries, and theatrical trailers for each of the three films. \n\n\"The Godfather\" is accompanied by twenty-three scene selections; \"Part II\" by thirty scene selections; and \"Part III\" by twenty-five scene selections. Oh, and click around on the various menus for \"extra\" extras not mentioned. English and French are available for spoken languages, with English subtitles an option for the hearing impaired. The way I figure it, if you watch each of the three films one time through, it will take you something over nine hours. If you watch them a second time through with Coppola\'s commentary, you\'ve got another nine hours. Then, if you watch the bonus disc with its several more hours of material, you\'ve got enough stuff in this box to keep you entertained and informed for nearly a twenty-four hour period. Seems like a deal to me.\n\nParting Thoughts:\nCelluloid outlaws and hoodlums have been with us since the earliest days of Edwin S. Porter and D.W. Griffith, but, ironically, it would be the U.S. Government that indirectly encouraged Hollywood\'s major excursions into the world of gangsters. As a consequence of lawmakers\' ill-conceived legislation leading to Prohibition in the twenties, Americans consumed more alcohol per capita than at any time before or since. Concurrently, to quench the country\'s thirst for illicit booze, there was an attendant rise in organized crime that would go largely unchecked for the next fifty years. Is it any wonder that Hollywood would document this phenomenon in movies of the thirties and make stars of such actors as Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, Paul Muni, Humphrey Bogart, George Raft, and others?\n\nI\'m sure no one is proud of the dark side of America\'s past or present, nor have most serious filmmakers attempted to glorify or glamorize the subject matter. But that hasn\'t stopped the public from being fascinated by gangsterism all the same. Coppola followed a time-honored Hollywood tradition in making his Corleone family trilogy, adding a depth of character, background, and narration that had never been achieved so successfully in gangster films before, a depth that would only be approached by Martin Scorsese\'s hard-edged \"Mean Streets,\" \"Goodfellas,\" and \"Casino\" in the years that followed. \"The Godfather\" movies represent filmmaking at its best--from their superb characterizations and acting to their innovative direction and striking camera work. Paramount\'s DVD presentation of the films is the best we could hope for, short of some future high-definition transfers projected on theater-sized home screens. Until that day, the present silver-disc \"Godfather Collection\" is an offer that\'s hard to refuse.'),(10125,'The Godfather III','At the beginning of The Godfather Part III, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now an aging don bent on respectability (as opposed to respect), heads up an afternoon charity function and announces his contribution of $100 million to a fund for the preservation of Sicily. The telltale sum is at once generous and obscene: Anyone who can afford to give this much is clearly not to be trusted. Yet Michael, in his way, is on the level. Having purged the Corleones of all their gambling operations, he\'s now intent on converting the family assets into a legitimate business enterprise. It\'s not so much that Michael has gone soft as that he\'s tired. Even monsters need to sleep.\nHere, as in the first Godfather, we watch the Corleone family celebrating its prosperity, its bonds, the romance of family itself. The year is 1979, and Michael, no longer married, dances ceremoniously with his daughter (Sofia Coppola), a teenage flirt who looks more Old World Italian than he does. The scene is almost heartbreaking in its evocation of the wedding ceremony that opened the first Godfather. Even the Sinatra-like crooner Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) is on hand. He\'s middle-aged now, and pretty much taken for granted, though watching him run through his golden-throated shtick, one can\'t help but recall what had to happen — remember that severed horse\'s head? — in order for him to hold on to his career.\nFrom its opening scenes, The Godfather Part III has a curious and yearning aura of atonement. Michael is desperate to make up for his sins, and so is Francis Ford Coppola, who has spent the better part of two decades straining to live up to the achievement of the first two Godfathers — perhaps the greatest fusion of artistry and popular success in the history of American movies. When Coppola signed on to direct Godfather III, he wasn\'t simply agreeing to carry on the saga of the Corleones, the Italian-American family who made organized crime seem at once horrifying and weirdly romantic. He was agreeing to revive the kind of richly detailed classical storytelling that has all but disappeared from the American cinema.\nThe miracle is that he pulls it off. The Godfather Part III isn\'t the overpoweringly great movie the first Godfather was (let\'s be reasonable — how could it have been?), and it lacks the bone-chilling gradations of darkness that made The Godfather Part II a singular American tragedy. This one is slower, talkier, and more prosaic: two hours of exposition and 40 minutes of payoff. What\'s more, its narrative seams sometimes show. Yet by the end, the movie has attained a deep-grained emotional grandeur that can hold its own with that of the other two films. For the first time since Apocalypse Now (1979), Coppola has recovered the gift of epic storytelling. Watching this flawed, spellbinding, end-of-a-dynasty epic, I realized that the folly of Coppola\'s career during the past decade — in films like One From the Heart, Rumble Fish, Peggy Sue Got Married, and Tucker: The Man and His Dream — is that he willed himself into becoming a fantasist. The Godfather Part III marks his triumphant return to operatic realism. The film revives Coppola\'s career even as it brings Michael Corleone\'s to a fittingly stark finale.\nAttempting to preserve and extend his empire, Michael enters into a shady corporate deal with the Vatican, negotiating with an amusingly cynical and worldly archbishop (Donal Donnelly) who drops bottom-line figures between puffs on his cigarette. It seems that the Vatican bank is in debt and could use a fast $600 million. If Michael provides it, he can take over Immobiliare, a world-wide real-estate company of which the Vatican owns a quarter share. But the plan is too good to be true. Standing in its way is a loose conspiracy of interests extending from a John Gotti-like celebrity gangster (Joe Mantegna) to one of Michael\'s most trusted cronies.\nWhat\'s defeating Michael isn\'t merely a few greedy rivals but the Mafia\'s eternal cycle of violence: Michael wants out, and it can\'t be done. Not helping matters is the emergence of Vincent (Andy Garcia), a fearless young punk stud who\'s the illegitimate son of Michael\'s late brother Sonny. Vincent is eager to join the family, and Michael, in part because his own son has rejected his criminal ways, agrees to take him on. Yet right from the start, it\'s clear that this grinning shark in his black-leather sports jacket lacks the discipline — the respect for his elders — required to rise in the mob. He\'s of the new, nihilistic generation: The Last Corleone.\nThe story moves to Sicily and stays there, becoming a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses. Coppola and coscreenwriter Mario Puzo have concocted a densely packed narrative that builds very slowly. The movie, however, is more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions. For Coppola is telling a story of emotional incest: He shows us a family strangled by its own blood ties. Vincent falls into a queasily intense romantic involvement with his first cousin — Michael\'s daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola). Meanwhile, Connie (Talia Shire), Michael\'s sister, has become, in effect, his surrogate wife, a shadowy schemer who hatches assassination plots when her brother hasn\'t the will. It\'s the collective pull of these two — the daughter and the sister — that draws Michael back into the fray.\nAndy Garcia is as magnetic as ever, yet Vincent has been made into a standard post-De Niro hothead. And so there\'s no way he can become as resonant a central character as this series demands. Coppola would have done well to make him a little smarter, take him back to the U.S., and enmesh him in a booby-trapped gangster melodrama, something to offset the more meditative goings-on in Sicily.\nYet what Coppola has given us is, in its own way, richly satisfying. Pacino creates a towering portrait of a man torn between his dreams and his guilt. Michael longs for redemption yet ends up losing everything he ever cared about. He has an impromptu confession scene that is at once searing and tender, and Coppola and Puzo, borrowing liberally from headlines about the Vatican scandals of the late \'70s, add a brilliantly blasphemous zinger by having his father confessor turn out to be the cardinal who is later chosen as the new pope. Talia Shire, who has never been that interesting an actress, gives the performance of her life, playing Connie with the dark stealth of a Mafia Lady Macbeth. And Eli Wallach is superb as an aging don whose grandfatherly kindliness is revealed to be a mask of treachery. As for Coppola\'s 19-year-old daughter, Sofia, she\'s obviously a nonactress, yet her Valley Girl nonchalance is apparently just what the director wanted. Coppola is saying that in a mass-culture age, even the daughter of a titan is as much a product of the world around her as she is of her family.\nThe movie culminates in a brilliant 30-minute-long set piece, with Coppola cutting between several related assassinations and the opera that most of the instigators are attending. It\'s one of the most complexly layered suspense scenes ever filmed, a kind of slow-motion Hitchcockian roller coaster. The weapons range from guns to poisoned cannoli, and one of the assassinations — a kamikaze attack on a mob boss — is more hauntingly horrific than anything in the first two Godfathers. With this sequence, Coppola unveils a vision of corruption that embraces the entire world. Yet he\'s also reveling in sheer theatrical magic in a way that only a master can. The entire sequence — indeed, the very movie we\'ve been watching — becomes pure opera, as Coppola rediscovers his voice. A'),(10126,'A typical affable and middling Bob Hope comedy.','A typical affable and middling Bob Hope comedy (lots of one-liners, mistaken identity gags and sight gags--plus Hope in drag), except this time it\'s for MGM instead of Paramount. This means lavish Technicolor and production values. The story is by Sy Bartlett and the team of writers are Everett Freeman, Don Hartman and Melville Shavelson. It\'s directed by David Butler (\"The Road to Morocco\"). Bing Crosby makes a cameo in a novel ending.\n\nBob Hope plays Sylvester the Great, a two-bit magician/actor on a ship \"touring\" the West Indies in the 18th century. Virginia Mayo is Princess Margaret, who is also on the ship. She\'s a real princess traveling in disguise because she ran away from her father who will not allow her to marry the commoner she loves. The two are kidnapped by a ruthless buccaneer called The Hook (Victor McLaglen), who has an iron claw in place of his missing hand. Though a confirmed coward, Sylvester disguises himself as a gypsy woman and with the help of a pirate, the ships\'s half-wit tattooer named Featherhead (Walter Brennan), is able to miraculously escape with Margaret in a dinghy. Featherhead lays on him the treasure map he stole from Captain Hook to some hidden treasure before they depart, with the condition he deliver it to his cousin. They arrive in the violent port town of Featherhead\'s cousin, where they must wait two weeks because the cousin won\'t return until then. To earn money Sylvester performs in a local cabaret. Soon Margaret is kidnapped by the corrupt governor named La Roche (Walter Slezak), who recognizes her as the missing princess and assumes Sylvester is the commoner she ran away with. Things get more dicey when it\'s discovered that The Hook is the secret partner of La Roche and has arrived in the port town. Sylvester also discovers that the treasure map has been tattooed onto his chest. Feeling love for the woman he doesn\'t believe is a princess, he acts to rescue her. The question becomes after he acts so bravely, is whether or not he will get the girl!\n\nThe film is helped considerably by strong supporting turns by Brennan, Slezak and McLaglen.'),(10127,'LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING','We invest Hobbits with qualities that cannot be visualized. In my mind, they are good-hearted, bustling, chatty little creatures who live in twee houses or burrows, and dress like the merry men of Robin Hood--in smaller sizes, of course. They eat seven or eight times a day, like to take naps, have never been far from home and have eyes that grow wide at the sounds of the night. They are like children grown up or grown old, and when they rise to an occasion, it takes true heroism, for they are timid by nature and would rather avoid a fight.\nSuch notions about Hobbits can be found in \"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,\" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end \"Fellowship\" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien.\nThe Ring Trilogy embodies the kind of innocence that belongs to an earlier, gentler time. The Hollywood that made \"The Wizard of Oz\" might have been equal to it. But \"Fellowship\" is a film that comes after \"Gladiator\" and \"Matrix,\" and it instinctively ramps up to the genre of the overwrought special-effects action picture. That it transcends this genre--that it is a well-crafted and sometimes stirring adventure--is to its credit. But a true visualization of Tolkien\'s Middle-earth it is not.\nWondering if the trilogy could possibly be as action-packed as this film, I searched my memory for sustained action scenes and finally turned to the books themselves, which I had not read since the 1970s. The chapter \"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\" provides the basis for perhaps the most sensational action scene in the film, in which Gandalf the wizard stands on an unstable rock bridge over a chasm, and must engage in a deadly swordfight with the monstrous Balrog. This is an exciting scene, done with state-of-the-art special effects and sound that shakes the theater. In the book, I was not surprised to discover, the entire scene requires less than 500 words.\nSettling down with my book, the one-volume, 1969 India paper edition, I read or skimmed for an hour or so. It was as I remembered it. The trilogy is mostly about leaving places, going places, being places, and going on to other places, all amid fearful portents and speculations. There are a great many mountains, valleys, streams, villages, caves, residences, grottos, bowers, fields, high roads, low roads, and along them the Hobbits and their larger companions travel while paying great attention to mealtimes. Landscapes are described with the faithful detail of a Victorian travel writer. The travelers meet strange and fascinating characters along the way, some of them friendly, some of them not, some of them of an order far above Hobbits or even men. Sometimes they must fight to defend themselves or to keep possession of the ring, but mostly the trilogy is an unfolding, a quest, a journey, told in an elevated, archaic, romantic prose style that tests our capacity for the declarative voice.\nReading it, I remembered why I liked it in the first place. It was reassuring. You could tell by holding the book in your hands that there were many pages to go, many sights to see, many adventures to share. I cherished the way it paused for songs and poems, which the movie has no time for. Like The Tale of Genji, which some say is the first novel, \"The Lord of the Rings\" is not about a narrative arc or the growth of the characters, but about a long series of episodes in which the essential nature of the characters is demonstrated again and again (and again). The ring, which provides the purpose for the journey, serves Tolkien as the ideal MacGuffin, motivating an epic quest while mostly staying right there on a chain around Frodo Baggins\' neck.\nPeter Jackson, the New Zealand director who masterminded this film (and two more to follow, in a $300 million undertaking), has made a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right; the Hobbits may not look like my idea of Hobbits (may, indeed, look like full-sized humans made to seem smaller through visual trickery), but they have the right combination of twinkle and pluck in their gaze--especially Elijah Wood as Frodo and Ian Holm as the worried Bilbo.\nYet the taller characters seem to stand astride the little Hobbit world and steal the story away. Gandalf the good wizard (Ian McKellen) and Saruman the treacherous wizard (Christopher Lee) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), who is the warrior known as Strider, are so well-seen and acted, so fearsome in battle, that we can\'t imagine the Hobbits getting anywhere without them. The elf Arwen (Liv Tyler), the Elf Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Arwen\'s father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), are not small like literary elves (\"very tall they were,\" the book tells us), and here they tower like Norse gods and goddesses, accompanied by so much dramatic sound and lighting that it\'s a wonder they can think to speak, with all the distractions.\nJackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions. I like the way he handles crowds of Orcs in the big battle scenes, wisely knowing that in a film of this kind, realism has to be tempered with a certain fanciful fudging. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. \"This tale grew in the telling,\" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it\'s as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination.\nThat \"Fellowship of the Ring\" doesn\'t match my imaginary vision of Middle-earth is my problem, not yours. Perhaps it will look exactly as you think it should. But some may regret that the Hobbits have been pushed out of the foreground and reduced to supporting characters. And the movie depends on action scenes much more than Tolkien did. In a statement last week, Tolkien\'s son Christopher, who is the \"literary protector\" of his father\'s works, said, \"My own position is that \'The Lord of the Rings\' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form.\" That is probably true, and Jackson, instead of transforming it, has transmuted it, into a sword-and-sorcery epic in the modern style, containing many of the same characters and incidents.'),(10128,'Terminator, The','The Terminator, the film that catapulted Arnold Schwarzengger into Hollywood\'s stratosphere, was never designed for more than a niche audience. Indeed, while the film made a nice profit for Orion Pictures (returning grosses about six times its cost), it did not make the kind of money that would cause it to be labeled a \"blockbuster\" or that would justify a sequel. But The Terminator arrived at a time when America\'s appetite for science fiction was escalating and when the home video revolution was taking off. Although only a minor success in theaters, The Terminator was a gargantuan hit on home video. And, when James Cameron solidified his reputation by directing Aliens, it became unthinkable that there would not be a sequel to The Terminator.\n\nThe movie\'s strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas. This isn\'t a run-of-the-mill turn-off-the-brain collection of chases and fight scenes. The plot, which involves time travel and the paradoxes inherent therein, requires viewers to pay attention or risk having no idea what\'s happening. I remember leaving the theater 25 years ago and hearing a girl remark: \"I liked it but I didn\'t understand what was going on. Was that guy from the future Arnold\'s father?\" Cameron, as it turns out, took a little too much license in claiming full credit for the story. Noted science fiction author Harlan Ellison sued, arguing that The Terminator bore more than a passing resemblance to two of his Outer Limits teleplays, \"Soldier\" (about two time-traveling soldiers who end up in 1964, where they fight to the death) and \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" (about a time-traveling robot that looks like a man). The settlement resulted in Ellison gaining an on-tape credit as well as an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nIt is 1984. The stillness of the night is interrupted as a portal in time opens. Through that portal arrives The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a ruthless killer from the year 2029. Future Earth is at war: man against machines. The Terminator\'s mission is to eliminate the leader of the humans before his birth. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the eventual mother of John Connor, has been targeted for termination. But The Terminator is not the only one to make use of a time portal. Also sent through is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), John Connor\'s right-hand-man. His goal: protect Sarah.\n\nThe Terminator is structured as one long chase, with the vulnerable Sarah and Reese fleeing from the relentless Terminator. At first, Sarah distrusts Reese, believing him to be demented. But, once The Terminator has destroyed a police station and killed most of the cops within, she has no choice but to trust Reese. That bond develops into a romance, but The Terminator\'s pursuit allows little opportunity for down time or sweet nothings. Nevertheless, Cameron has a knack for getting us to care about the characters and their relationship even though not a lot of time is spent getting to know them. (There are actually more \"character building\" sequences in the more heavily action-oriented Terminator 2.)\n\nKey special effects, which were cutting edge in 1984, appear dated by today\'s standards. Stan Winston\'s stop-animation Terminator, which takes over for Schwarzenegger at the end, looks like what it is: the product of a special effects lab. It\'s not credible, but the story is strong enough to overcome such shortcomings. In fact, some of the other visual chicanery - time travel effects, Schwarzenegger\'s makeup, and flash-forward scenes set in a post-apocalyptic 2029 - are effective. By the time Terminator 2 arrived, Cameron had both the budget and the ability to better integrate the robot Terminator into its surroundings. The herky-jerky awkwardness that marks the climax of the first movie is not evident during the sequels.\n\nParadoxes inevitably form the entertainment core for any time travel story, and The Terminator is no exception. (SPOILER AHEAD!) In this case, the supposition is that a person can die before he is born as long as his personal time line is unbroken. Thus, Reese comes into the world at a time after the events chronicled in The Terminator, then travels back to a date before his birth, fathers the son who will send him back, and is \"terminated\" before he is born. This is not a complex time travel concept (requiring only an understanding of time as fluid), and it\'s more straightforward than the one addressed in Terminator 2.\n\nIn the casting department, few character/actor pairings have been better fits than Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. In 1984, the former Mr. Olympia boasted limited feature acting experience (primarily from two Conan movies) but provided what Cameron wanted from The Terminator: an imposing physique and an implacable countenance. Schwarzenegger had both, and his Achilles heel - the occasional inability to deliver dialogue convincingly - was not an impediment. The role demanded only the occasional one-liner (one of which, \"I\'ll be back,\" became the actor\'s trademark). Cameron transformed every one of Schwarzenegger\'s perceived negatives into strengths and, in the process, re-defined him in Hollywood\'s eyes. In the wake of The Terminator, Schwarzenegger was in demand.\n\nThe film\'s other two leads, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, share some acting characteristics - neither has tremendous range but both are charismatic, physically adept, and provide the requisite intensity. Biehn was a Cameron \"regular\" early in his career, then moved fully into B movies, an arena where he continues to thrive. Genre fans remember him best as Hicks, Sigourney Weaver\'s semi-love interest from Aliens. Linda Hamilton was virtually unknown at the time of her casting. In years to come, she would reprise this role (in a considerably buffed up form), marry and divorce James Cameron (she was his fourth wife), and become a beloved cult figure for her part in the TV series Beauty and the Beast.\n\nThe potential evidenced by Cameron in The Terminator - the ability to sustain suspense, meld action with story, and provide compelling characters despite the limitations of the actors portraying them - would be fully realized in two future features, Aliens and Terminator 2. This movie, however, is in some ways more impressive than either of those because of what the filmmaker was capable of achieving with a limited budget and without significant studio backing. The themes and ideas presented in The Terminator hold up well today, even though we have moved into the post-Cold War era and only the most nihilistic individuals could see 2029 in such bleak terms. It\'s a rousing science fiction story that proves an on-screen adrenaline rush need not short-circuit the brain.'),(10129,'Spirited Away','To animators across the world, Hayao Miyazaki is a god. Within the animation community, his work is revered, and fans of “anime” (Japanese animation) await each new Miyazaki film with the same degree of ill-concealed impatience as displayed by 11-year olds hungering for the next book in the “Harry Potter” series. In mainstream United States movie-going circles, Miyazaki is not a well-known name, which is one reason why, several years ago, Walt Disney Pictures purchased the North American rights to Miyazaki’s catalog. While there were some gripes about the manner in which the dubbing and distribution of Miyazaki’s previous feature, Princess Mononoke, were handled here, more care has been taken for Spirited Away. Two American animation luminaries – Pixar’s John Lasseter and Disney’s Kirk Wise (the director of several animated features, including Beauty and the Beast) – were recruited to convert the Japanese version of the movie into one for English-speaking audiences.\n\nLet me state up front that I am neither a fan of, nor an expert on, anime. In fact, I’m not a lover of animation in general. But I know when I’m in the presence of good storytelling, and Spirited Away represents that. Watching this movie, you immediately become aware of two things – the animation is excellent (something that will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen one of Miyazaki’s previous outings) and the story turns in unusual, often unexpected directions. One of the biggest problems I have with many animated films (even the best ones) is plot predictability. That’s not the case here.\n\nSpirited Away takes influences from “Alice in Wonderland” and “The Wizard of Oz” and uses them to fashion a highly original story about a 10 year-old girl, Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase), who, along with her parents, ventures through a tunnel that leads to the world of spirits. After a witch, Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), turns Mom and Dad into pigs, Chihiro must find a niche in the spirit world, where humans are not well thought-of, and figure out a way to convince Yubaba to change her parents back into humans and send them all home. With help from Haku (Jason Marsden), Yubaba’s boy apprentice, and Lin (Susan Egan), a “big sister” type, Chihiro gets a job at Yubaba’s bathhouse for sprits, and there her quest to aid her family begins. But, as complications arise, she finds additional tasks to perform and other allies willing to help her.\n\nThe nature of the story is tailor-made for animation. Many of the characters engage in shape-shifting (boys become dragons, adults become pigs, a giant baby becomes a bloated mouse) and the bathhouse is frequented by a variety of strange and unusual creatures. While a few of the inhabitants of the sprit world look human, most appear to be anything but that. Take the boiler operator Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers), for example. At first glance, he’s just a cranky old man with a frizzy beard. Then we notice that he has eight legs and walks like a spider. We also find out that he’s not as intimidating as he looks. His initially surly disposition melts away and he becomes of one Chihiro’s numerous friends.\n\nMiyazaki is an environmentalist, and his films often contain strong pro-environment messages. (This was a cornerstone to Princess Mononoke.) In Spirited Away, one of the visitors to the bathhouse is a river spirit who has been so badly polluted by sludge and other waste materials that his stench drives people away and he is in need of a powerful cleansing to sluice away the filth. It takes an effort, but he is eventually restored to his former glory.\n\nThe film’s animation is stunning, with richly-detailed backgrounds and flawless foregrounds. Unlike many animators, Miyazaki still relies almost exclusively upon hand-drawn artwork (although he employs some computer technology to touch up and enhance the final product), and his meticulous care shows. The colors are bright and vivid, and some of the scenes (especially those taking place during a rainstorm) are peerless in the world of motion picture animation. Also, with a running length that exceeds two hours (124 minutes), Spirited Away requires approximately 40% more cells than what is needed for the average Disney release.\n\nMiyazaki does not dumb down Spirited Away, even though his stated target audience is children. This is a true family film, in that adults will be as enchanted by the characters and situations as children will. The pace is a little slower than the average animated film – there is not as much frantic action – but not so languid that younger viewers will become restless. The dubbing into English is very good (as is voice selection), so there is no subtitle barrier. Overall, while Spirited Away may not be as complex and imaginative as Princess Mononoke in some areas, it is as beautifully rendered and no less sophisticated in its outlook. Miyazaki has provided another triumph, and, in the midst of the quality fall-off of Disney’s in-house animated projects, a reason for animation-lovers to rejoice.'),(10130,'Review: ‘The Godfather Part III’','The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu. In addition, the $55 million-plus production is the most personal of the three for the director.\n\nVariety Staff\nThe Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu. In addition, the $55 million-plus production is the most personal of the three for the director.\n\nLike the original, Part III opens with a lengthy festival celebration punctuated by backroom dealings. It is 1979, and Michael Corleone, having divested himself of his illegal operations, is being honored by the Catholic Church for his abundant charitable activities.\n\nHopeful of bringing his family closer together, Michael dotes on his daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), and understandably becomes perturbed by her affair with cousin Vincent (Andy Garcia), hot-headed, violence-prone illegitimate son of Michael’s late brother Sonny. Vincent has been unhappily working for slumlord and old-style thug Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), who has taken on Michael’s less savory holdings.\n\nBad blood between the ruthless Zasa and the Corleone family mounts just as Michael tries, with $600 million, to buy a controlling interest in the European conglomerate Immobiliare, a move that would cement his business legitimacy and financial future.\n\nAfter 80 minutes, the action switches to Italy, where it remains for the duration. Pacino and Eli Wallach’s old dons can’t help begin scheming against one another. In one of the most masterful examples of sustained intercutting in cinema, the performance on opening night of Pacino’s son in Cavalleria Rusticana serves as the backdrop for several murderous missions.\n\nFor the third time out in his career role, Pacino is magnificent. Garcia brings much-needed youth and juice to the ballsy Vincent, heir apparent to the Corleone tradition, much as James Caan sparked the first film and Robert De Niro invigorated the second.\n\nDiane Keaton proves a welcome, if brief, presence in warming the film, and Talia Shire seems pleased with the opportunity to do some dirty work at long last.\n\nFilm’s main flaw, unavoidably, is Sofia Coppola in the important, but not critical, role of Michael’s daughter. Unfortunate casting decision was made after original actress Winona Ryder had to bow out at the start of production.'),(10131,'Screen: \'Alien \'Brings Chills From the Far Galaxy:','A GIGANTIC construction moves serenely through space where, though the night never ends, there\'s always enough light to see strange objects. This one looks like the main set of D.W. Griffith\'s \"Intolerance.\" It\'s as if Babylon had been cut loose from earth to sail back through space to its own time. In actual fact, it\'s the cargo-ship Nostromo on its return to earth at the end of an extended voyage to the far end of the galaxy.\n\nWhen we go inside, the ship appears to have been as suddenly deserted as the Marie Celeste. We wander down empty corridors into abandoned living quarters, into engine rooms and, finally, into the command room where the computers are the only signs of life. The interior of the ship is vast. It contains the kind of waste space one seldom sees anymore except in some rare old Manhattan pile like the Dakota. Something decidedly eerie is going on.\n\nThus — familiarly but with immense promise — begins \"Alien,\" Ridley Scott\'s new, elaborately produced science-fiction film that opens today at the Criterion and other theaters. However, as this voyage continues, familiarity consumes the promise and leaves as residue the memory of some shrieks from shocks of a most mundane kind.\n\nThe crew of the Nostromo has not vanished. They are merely sleeping the time away and, shortly after the opening credits, they come forth from their sleep-pods to prepare for their re-entry into the earth\'s orbit. It\'s then that they encounter peculiar signals from the wreck of another space ship, one from another galaxy and one which has crashed onto an uncharted planetoid. The Nostromo stops to investigate, locates the craft and, when it takes off again for earth, it carries aboard a specimen of alien life, a small, octopus-like blob that won\'t stop growing and — possibly worse — is \"unclouded by conscience or delusions of morality.\"\n\nThat\'s about all one should or can say about the story originally conceived by Dan O\'Bannon and turned into a screenplay by him and Ronald Shusett.\n\n\"Alien\" is an extremely small, rather decent movie of its modest kind, set inside a large, extremely fancy physical production. Don\'t race to it expecting the wit of \"Star Wars\" or the metaphysical pretentions of \"2001\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" At its best it recalls \"The Thing,\" though the Howard Hawks film was both more imaginatively and more economically dramatized.\n\nIt\'s an old-fashioned scare movie about something that is not only implacably evil but prone to jumping out at you when (the movie hopes) you least expect it. There was once a time when this sort of thing was set in an old dark house, on a moor, in a thunderstorm. Being trendy, Mr. Scott and his associates have sent it up in space.\n\nAs he demonstrated with \"The Duellists,\" his first feature, Mr. Scott is a very stylish director. Though \"Alien\" is not the seminal science-fiction film one wants from him, it\'s executed with a good deal of no-nonsense verve. The members of the small cast are uniformly good though, with two exception, the roles might have been written by a computor.\n\nSigourney Weaver is impressive and funny as the Nostromo\'s executive officer, the second in command, a young woman who manages to act tough, efficient and sexy all at the same time. Ian Holm is also excellent as the ship\'s science officer, a man with a secret that will set him apart from everyone else forever.\n\nOther members of the crew are played by Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright, the actress who was so good in \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" She plays a somewhat similar role here, one that requires her to weep a lot and leaves her so red-eyed and red-nosed that she may be in danger of becoming the Isable Jewell of the living-color space-age.\n\n\"Alien\'s\" sets and special effects are well done, but these things no longer surprise or tantalize us as they once did. In a very short time, science-fiction films have developed their own jargon that\'s now become a part of the grammar of film. You know the sort of stuff I mean — the shots of blinking instrument panels, of wildly bleeping computers, of cryptic messages clattering in square type-faces across televisio screens. There\'s also the obligatory shot of that huge space vehicle early on in every film. It appears from over our right shoulder, passes over our head and then proceeds slowly and majestically toward the far distance at screen-left. When I first saw it in \"2001,\" it was awesome. Now it makes me feel like a turtle on a busy though unnaturally quiet highway.'),(10132,'BRAVEHEART','Mel Gibson\'s \"Braveheart\" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It\'s an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged.\nNot much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor.\nWallace\'s dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was \"freedom!\" That isn\'t exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn\'t stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of \"Braveheart,\" which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of \"The Road Warrior.\" What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, \"Braveheart\" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don\'t turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we\'re doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?).\nGibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but \"Braveheart\" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: \"Scotland\'s terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -.\" Uh, huh.\nIn the film, Wallace\'s chief antagonist is King Edward I (\"Longshanks\"), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that\'s all the more amusing since he\'s usually guessing wrong.\nEdward\'s son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. \"I may have to conceive the child myself!\" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or \"first night,\" nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers.\nThe Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window).\nEdward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she\'s spilling all the state secrets, \"because of the way you look at me.\" The Princess is the second love in Wallace\'s life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won\'t claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths.\nThese characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, \"That\'ll wake you up in the morning, boy!\") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling.\nAnd as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.'),(10133,'BATMAN BEGINS','\'Batman Begins\" at last penetrates to the dark and troubled depths of the Batman legend, creating a superhero who, if not plausible, is at least persuasive as a man driven to dress like a bat and become a vigilante. The movie doesn\'t simply supply Batman\'s beginnings in the tradition of a comic book origin story, but explores the tortured path that led Bruce Wayne from a parentless childhood to a friendless adult existence. The movie is not realistic, because how could it be, but it acts as if it is.\nOpening in a prison camp in an unnamed nation, \"Batman Begins\" shows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) enduring brutal treatment as a prisoner, as part of his research into the nature of evil. He is rescued by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who appoints himself Wayne\'s mentor, teaches him sword-fighting and mind control, and tries to enlist him in his amoral League of Shadows (\"We burned London to the ground\").\nWhen Wayne refuses to kill someone as a membership requirement, Ducard becomes his enemy; the reclusive millionaire returns to Gotham City determined to fight evil, without realizing quite how much trouble he is in.\nThe story of why he identifies with bats (childhood trauma) and hates evildoers (he saw his parents killed by a mugger) has been referred to many times in the various incarnations of the Batman legend, including four previous films. This time, it is given weight and depth. Wayne discovers in Gotham that the family Wayne Corp. is run by a venal corporate monster (Rutger Hauer), but that in its depths labors the almost forgotten scientific genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who understands Wayne wants to fight crime and offers him the weaponry.\nLucius happens to have on hand a prototype Batmobile, which unlike the streamlined models in the earlier movies, is a big, unlovely juggernaut that looks like a Humvee\'s wet dream. He also devises a bat-cape with surprising properties.\nThese preparations, Gotham crime details and the counsel of the faithful servant Alfred (Michael Caine) delay the actual appearance of Batman until the second act of the movie. We don\'t mind. Unlike the earlier films, which delighted in extravagant special-effects action, \"Batman Begins\" is shrouded in shadow; instead of high-detail, sharp-edged special effects, we get obscure developments in fog and smoke, reinforced by a superb sound-effects design. And Wayne himself is a slow learner, clumsy at times, taking foolish chances, inventing Batman as he goes along.\nThis is at last the Batman movie I\'ve been waiting for. The character resonates more deeply with me than the other comic superheroes, perhaps because when I discovered him as a child, he seemed darker and more grown-up than the cheerful Superman. He has secrets. As Alfred muses: \"Strange injuries and a nonexistent social life. These things beg the question, what does Bruce Wayne do with his time?\"\nWhat he does is create a high profile as a millionaire playboy who gets drunk and causes scenes. This disappoints Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), his friend since childhood, who is now an assistant D.A. She and Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), apparently Gotham City\'s only honest cop, are faced with a local crime syndicate led by Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). But Falcone\'s gang is child\'s play, compared to the deep scheme being hatched by the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), who, in the tradition of Victorian alienists, likes to declare his enemies insane and lock them up.\nCrane\'s secret identity as the Scarecrow fits into a scheme to lace the Gotham water supply with a psychedelic drug. Then a superweapon will be used to vaporize the water, citizens will inhale the drug, and it will drive them crazy, for reasons which the Scarecrow and his confederates explain with more detail than clarity. Meanwhile, flashbacks establish the character\'s deepest traumas, including his special relationship with bats and his guilt because he thinks he is responsible for his parents\' mugging.\nI admire, among other things, the way the movie doesn\'t have the gloss of the earlier films. The Batman costume is an early design. The Bat Cave is an actual cave beneath Wayne Manor. The Batmobile enters and leaves it by leaping across a chasm and through a waterfall. The Bat Signal is crude and out of focus.\nThe movie was shot on location in Chicago, making good use of the murky depths of lower Wacker Drive and the Board of Trade building (now the Wayne Corp.). Special effects add a spectacular monorail down La Salle Street, which derails in the best scene along those lines since \"The Fugitive.\"\nBale is just right for this emerging version of Batman. It\'s strange to see him muscular and toned, after his cadaverous appearance in \"The Machinist,\" but he suggests an inward quality that suits the character. Rachel is at first fooled by his facade of playboy irresponsibility, but Lt. Gordon figures out fairly quickly what Batman is doing, and why. Instead of one villain as the headliner, \"Batman Begins\" has a whole population, including Falcone, the Scarecrow, the Asian League of Shadows leader Ra\'s Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and a surprise bonus pick.\nThe movie has been directed by Christopher Nolan, still only 35, whose \"Memento\" (2000) took Sundance by storm and was followed by \"Insomnia\" (2002), a police procedural with Al Pacino. What Warner Bros. saw in those pictures that inspired them to think of Nolan is hard to say, but the studio guessed correctly, and after an eight-year hiatus, the Batman franchise has finally found its way.\nI said this is the Batman movie I\'ve been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for, because I didn\'t realize that more emphasis on story and character and less emphasis on high-tech action was just what was needed. The movie works dramatically in addition to being an entertainment. There\'s something to it.'),(10134,'The Godfather Part III','Francis Ford Coppola\'s \"The Godfather Part III\" isn\'t just a disappointment, it\'s a failure of heartbreaking proportions. Admittedly, \"The Godfather\" I and II, which are universally acclaimed as among the greatest works of the American cinema, are a tough act to follow; a very good film might be put alongside them and still not measure up. \"Godfather III,\" though, adds little more than a sad footnote to those earlier works.\n\nThe film completes the story of Vito Corleone and his sons, bringing us from the point at which the second film ended to the present day, from that image of an isolated Michael (Al Pacino) looking out from his boathouse office as the orders for his brother\'s murder are executed, to the anticlimactic ending. But in supplying the final chapter of the saga, it also sullies what came before. It makes you wish it had never been made.\n\nCoppola\'s star has dimmed significantly over the 16 years since the last \"Godfather\" film, but to see this third installment is to watch it fall out of the sky altogether. \"The Godfather Part III\" is the work of an artist estranged from his talent, a lost soul. In continuing the story of the Corleones, not only does Coppola fail to build on what he and his screenwriter Mario Puzo previously created; he also seems oblivious to what had made his story so compelling to begin with.\n\nThe characters that carry over from the earlier films bear little resemblance to themselves. The dread curve of Michael Corleone\'s life, which provided a dramatic spine for the family saga, has lost its sinister bend. At the beginning of \"Part III,\" Michael has come very close to realizing his dream of a completely legitimate family business. At a ceremony in his New York penthouse, he receives the Order of St. Sebastian from the Catholic Church, a lofty honor that may be connected to the $100 million donation given to the church by the Vito Corleone Foundation, a charity run by Michael\'s daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola). But this first act doesn\'t have the dramatic resonance of the wedding scene in \"Part I,\" or the celebration of Michael\'s son Anthony\'s first communion in \"Part II,\" because Michael no longer sits like a malignant spider at the center of his Mafia web. Michael is a businessman now, and in divesting himself of his criminal interests he has lost what made him interesting, his murderous darkness.\n\nIt\'s nearly impossible to see how the relentlessly brutal middle-aged man at the end of \"Part II\" could have grown into the relaxed, polished, easy-moving older one we see here. In some scenes -- like one in which he urges Vincent (Andy Garcia), his brother Sonny\'s hotheaded bastard son, to make the peace with a rival, Joey Zaza (Joe Mantegna) -- he seems almost charming -- a smiling, glad-handing lightweight. The action here takes place past the point where there is anything at stake, and it has, at times, an almost meditative quality, an old man\'s summing up.\n\nWith Michael missing from the film\'s center, the rest of the action seems ungrounded; it loses its moral dimension and becomes just another mob story. The two main plot threads concern the Corleone family\'s dealing with the Vatican, and Vincent\'s emergence as Michael\'s successor. The motives for Garcia\'s Vincent aren\'t split, the way Michael\'s have been. Violence is natural to him. He suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family\'s behalf, and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way Don Vito Corleone was. Garcia, as a result, seems to be the only actor in the film who knows what he\'s playing, the only one with a clear mission, and he gives a thrilling, feral performance. It\'s the film\'s strongest.\n\nPacino, for his part, flails around inside his character. His makeup is superb, though if he had been allowed to sweep back his hair it might have connected him physically to Garcia (and to Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, as well). Sometimes his choices are intriguing, and at times he draws something interesting to the surface of his performance. For the most part, though, he busies himself by paying attention to the details of playing an older man -- Michael is around 60 -- and goes not much deeper than that.\n\nSome of Coppola\'s choices -- for example, having Michael collapse suddenly into a diabetic coma when it was never mentioned that he suffers from the disease -- appear to have been made out of desperation. And some of the plotting -- particularly the handling of a conflict between the Corleones and the Luchese family over control of the Vatican\'s massive corporate holdings -- is tangled beyond comprehension. Some scenes -- such as the ones with Diane Keaton as Michael\'s wife, Kay -- are in the film because of studio politics, and not because Puzo and Coppola have anything of importance to say in them.\n\nEven though she is authoritative in the role, Keaton suffers tremendously from having no real function except to nag Michael for his past sins. (She\'s also anchored with some of the film\'s most painful dialogue.) Eli Wallach has a few hammy moments as Don Altabello, an old mob friend who turns out to be an enemy. Bridget Fonda, who plays a journalist, has only two small scenes that contribute nothing whatsoever, and George Hamilton contributes a few atrocious moments as the family\'s PR man. Talia Shire\'s part as Michael\'s sister, Connie, has been expanded in \"Part III,\" but the conception for the character seems to vary from scene to scene, so that at one moment she\'s a screaming crackpot and the next a power-hungry behind-the-scenes plotter.\n\nThe romance between Mary and Vincent is one of the film\'s main subplots, and as Mary, Sofia Coppola is hopelessly amateurish. Still, the part is a relatively small one, and her failure -- contrary to much that has already been written -- contributes very little to what is actually wrong with the film.\n\nIt may be that Coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say. As an epic metaphor for the American dream, the first two \"Godfather\" films are nearly perfect. The connections they made go deep into the story of this country, deep into our sense of ourselves and the contradictions in our lives. As a generational story, they had the richness and scope of Shakespeare. But the man who made those two masterpieces is not the man who has given us this failed final chapter. Though he reassembled many of the members of his old team -- his actors, Puzo, cinematographer Gordon Willis and production designer Dean Tavoularis -- his talent for filmmaking is eclipsed now by his gift for self-destruction. If that great earlier artist ever had a chance of resurfacing, it was here. But he didn\'t and you can\'t help but see \"The Godfather Part III\" as his headstone.'),(10135,'THE GODFATHER','We know from Gay Talese’s book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn’t all sunshine and roses. More often, it’s the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of “The Godfather,” which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what’s left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.\n\nThe remarkable thing about Mario Puzo’s novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn’t give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.\nThe movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone’s family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.\n“The Godfather” himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father’s position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather’s role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.\nThose who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.\nBut Brando’s performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.\nThe rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although “The Godfather” is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn’t time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he’ll have to cancel his day at the races).\nThe success of “The Godfather” as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn’t miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone’s daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.\nCoppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so “The Godfather” becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they’d tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn’t have worked. But it’s uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.\nAlthough the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can’t quite understand unless you’ve read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.'),(10136,'Miami Vice','The two best words to describe the 2006 motion picture Miami Vice are \"stylish\" and \"intense.\" One of those descriptors without the other could lead one to suspect a pretentious bore or a pointless exercise in action but, by pairing them, writer/director Michael Mann has crafted a gripping, visually interesting motion picture that doesn\'t fail on the basis of its needlessly convoluted plot and its hit-or-miss character arcs. As police dramas go, Miami Vice never loses its audience, in part because it is unpredictable (you never feel like anyone, even the lead characters, is destined to survive the proceedings) and in part because it never slows down.\n\nCalling the film Miami Vice is unnecessary - a marketing artifact. Aside from a few character names, little of the 1980s TV show remains in the motion picture. The movie is more reminiscent of Mann\'s films Heat and Collateral than it is of the television program his name became associated with. Viewers who go into Miami Vice with the baggage of expectations may be disappointed by what they find. Like The Untouchables, this is a case in which the big screen version is a complete re-imagining of its small screen forebear. There are no cutting edge fashions. The music is new (even \"In the Air Tonight\" is a cover). And there are no cameos or instances of original stars reprising roles. (Although Edward James Olmos was offered the opportunity to return as Lt. Castillo, scheduling conflicts with Battlestar Galactica forced him to decline.)\n\nThe premise has Miami cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) going undercover to discover and plug a leak in the FBI that has resulted in a busted sting and several deaths. Posing as transportation experts, they meet with drug smuggler Jose Yero (John Oritz) and his associate, Isabella (Gong Li), to propose that they replace Yero\'s current distribution apparatus and handle shipments of his illegal merchandise to the United States. Yero is suspicious, but his boss, Montoya (Luis Tosar), overrules him. Meanwhile, Isabella acts as Montoya\'s go-between and begins an affair with Crockett.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there\'s not a lot of action in Miami Vice, and most of it occurs during the final 30 minutes. Mann is an expert at sleight of hand, however, and the film seems more combustible than it is. A lot of that has to do with the throbbing soundtrack and a pervasive sense of danger. Scenes such as the one in which Crockett and Tubbs introduce themselves to Yero aren\'t violent, but they bubble with the potential for a bloodbath. Likewise, Crockett\'s affair with Isabella treads along the razor\'s edge of betrayal and catastrophe.\n\nThe romantic interaction of the leads help to humanize them, broadening them beyond the confines of the stereotypical \"rogue cops\" - tight partners who don\'t play by the rules. There\'s chemistry in the seemingly unlikely pairing of Gong Li and Colin Farrell. Less attention is paid to the liaison between Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris\' Trudy Joplin, but this relationship has an important outcome.\n\nFarrell and Foxx are fine in their roles as long as one doesn\'t start comparing them to Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. We believe these two are the smartest, slickest cops to do this job - fearless in the face of death and willing to risk everything. One senses that the real payoff may not be getting the bad guys, but getting off on the adrenaline of the chase and the thrill of dancing with the devil. International Chinese superstar Gong Li has difficulty with her English and Spanish (although, to be fair, there was little of her minimal dialogue that I didn\'t understand), but she does her best acting non-verbally. Her sex scene with Farrell is moving, as we see tears in her eyes. Thereafter, we observe the previously icy exterior thaw. John Ortiz is okay as the chief antagonist, although he\'s hardly likely to challenge Alan Rickman or Dennis Hopper for a spot in the Villains\' Hall of Fame.\n\nThere\'s a noticeable absence of red in Miami Vice, with blues being amplified. Contrast is low in many night scenes, with noticeable grain. Whether these stylistic choices benefit Miami Vice is open to debate, but they give the film a distinct look. In many ways, the movie has a dirtier, grittier feel than its TV counterpart. The \'80s Miami Vice was pastels; the 2006 version is dark and at times almost monochromatic.\n\nThe best way to view this new Miami Vice is as something unconnected to its previous incarnation. That way, this version and the new interpretations of the actors can be allowed to stand on their own. As cop movies go, Miami Vice does interesting things with unoriginal material. This is to its credit - movies with more have failed, while this one succeeds on the basis of its fervor and immediacy. It\'s not the ultimate as either a cop movie or a TV adaptation, but it\'s better than average in both categories.'),(10137,'STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN','The peculiar thing about Spock is that, being half human and half Vulcan and therefore possessing about half the usual quota of human emotions, he consistently, if dispassionately, behaves as if he possessed very heroic human emotions indeed. He makes a choice in “Star Trek II” that would be made only by a hero, a fool, or a Vulcan. And when he makes his decision, the movie rises to one of its best scenes, because the \"Star Trek\" stories have always been best when they centered around their characters. Although I liked the special effects in the first movie, they were probably not the point; fans of the TV series wanted to see their favorite characters again, and “Trek II” understood that desire and acted on it. \nTime has passed since the last episode. Kirk has retired to an administrative post. Spock is commanding the Enterprise, with a lot of new faces in the crew. The ship is on a mission concerning the Genesis device, a new invention which, if I understand it correctly, is capable of seeding a barren planet with luxuriant life. A sister ship, the USS Reliant, is scouting for lifeless planets and finds one that seems to be dead, but its instruments pick up a small speck of life. Crew members investigate, and find the planet inhabited by an outlaw named Khan, who was exiled there years ago by Kirk, and has brooded of vengeance ever since. \nKhan is played as a cauldron of resentment by Ricardo Montalban, and his performance is so strong that he helps illustrate a general principle involving not only Star Trek but “Star Wars” (1977) and all the epic serials, especially the “James Bond” movies: Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph. In a curious way, Khan captures our sympathy, even though he is an evil man who introduces loathsome creatures into the ear canals of two Enterprise crew members. Montalban doesn\'t overact. He plays the character as a man of deeply wounded pride, whose bond of hatred with Admiral Kirk is stronger even than his traditional villain\'s desire to rule the universe. \nThere is a battle in outer space in this movie, a particularly inept one that owes more to \"Captain Video\" than to state-of-the-art special effects. I always love it when they give us spaceships capable of leaping across the universe, and then arm them with weapons so puny that a direct hit merely blows up a few control boards and knocks people off their feet. Somehow, though, I don\'t much care if the battles aren\'t that amazing, because the story doesn\'t depend on them. It\'s about a sacrifice made by Spock, and it draws on the sentiment and audience identification developed over the years by the TV series. \nPerhaps because of that bond, and the sense that an episode may be over but the Enterprise will carry on, the movie doesn\'t feel that it needs an ending in a conventional sense. The film closes with the usual \"Star Trek\" end narration, all about the ship\'s mission and its quest, and we are obviously being set up for a sequel. You could almost argue that the last few minutes of “Trek II” are a trailer for “Trek III”, but, no, that wouldn\'t be in the spirit of the Enterprise, would it?'),(10138,'Gladiator','It\'s tough selling bloody heroism on a Homeric scale to a younger crowd raised on Luke Skywalker and Rambo. These days, the machinery of spectacle has gotten so sophisticated and so stunt-driven that emotional depth only slows a guy down. (The apotheosis of hero-dude blankness: Keanu Reeves\' Neo in The Matrix.) Yet it\'s Steven Spielberg, grand wizard of stunts and special effects, who has most influentially steered contemporary notions of bravery back along older-fashioned routes. Grand and rousing, Gladiator owes its shape and scope to the splashy historical \'\'sword-and-sandal movies\'\' of the 1950s and \'60s, legendary cinema circuses like Ben-Hur and Spartacus. But Maximus (Russell Crowe), the charismatic general who stands at the center of director Ridley Scott\'s giant arena, is, but for the breastplate, shield, and (when goaded into it) bloodthirsty fury, a brother-in-attitude of Tom Hanks\' Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan. They\'re decent men forced by circumstance to perform extraordinary feats, faithful husbands who just want to go home, but who take up arms instead to fix a broken world. (They\'re also both attached to units out of DreamWorks, Spielberg\'s global theater of operations.)\nLike Private Ryan, Gladiator charges into heart-pounding battle just minutes into the first reel. Assembling his Roman legions for an assault on a barbarian horde, Maximus, the well-liked leader, circulates easily among his troops. \'\'At my signal—unleash hell!\'\' he orders, whereupon Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. It\'s a bravura sequence of flaming arrows, falling horses, and mortal combat that doesn\'t copy Private Ryan\'s famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. It\'s Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe.\nThe victory pleases Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who loves Maximus more than he does his own weak yet treacherous son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), or Commodus\' shrewd, comely sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). The dying emperor would like the Spanish-born Maximus to succeed him, paving the way for Rome to once again become a republic, but Commodus doesn\'t take the news well; for an indolent weasel, he\'s remarkably resourceful about killing everyone Maximus loves. He nearly succeeds in having Maximus killed, too. Wounded, the general escapes but is then captured by slave traders, sold into bondage, and marked for certain death under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), a cynical supplier of gladiators for all occasions.\nMaximus\' incognito return to Rome to fight in the Colosseum (in front of the new emperor, Commodus), his quick rise to fame as the town\'s winningest warrior, and his big showdown with his old adversary fill the last act of Gladiator—as do a dazzling display of old-time Roman crowd scenes and stadium acts conjured with computerized magic that would have slayed old sandal-movie showmen like William Wyler and Cecil B. DeMille. But as much as the director\'s mise-en-scène dazzles, this is the rare Ridley Scott production in which individual characters have relatively secure separate identities. Certainly those incorrigible old thespians Harris and Reed play the bejaysus out of their character roles; there\'s also a deliciously creepy perversity elegantly mustered by Phoenix. (His Commodus is entirely too enamored of his sister, but then again, as happens in such muscle-bound extravaganzas, Lucilla appears to be the only woman residing in all of the Eternal City.) And it\'s a sly pleasure to see Derek Jacobi tied in a toga again as the empire\'s most reputable senator, some two decades after the actor starred on public television in the definitive Roman historical saga, I, Claudius.\nGladiator, though, is Crowe\'s to win or lose—Caesar\'s thumb up or thumb down, as it were. And he wins, colossally. The New Zealand-born, Australian-raised actor\'s performances have each been so completely different from one another, his transformation so complete and self-abnegating as to erase the notion of a fundamental Russell Crowe. Previously, this disarming lack of a portable, consistent, publicity-friendly acting personality has gotten in the way of his becoming a marquee star. Not any more. The puffy, ashen whistle-blower Crowe played in The Insider (for which he jolly well deserved the Oscar) has vanished, replaced by a brawny army general used to working the land.\nThis Maximus, with his lovely, meaty 1950s body mass like that of a William Holden or Robert Mitchum, has a farmer\'s vanity-free self-confidence; he needs to hold and smell a handful of the earth before each battle. Heartily masculine, commanding yet capable of temperance, and with a warily, wearily understanding gaze, Crowe makes Maximus\' desire to go home when his job is done the greatest aspiration a man can have. Whether or not he gets there in the end doesn\'t matter. What matters for today\'s hero is the good fight, and Gladiator KOs us with a doozy. A-'),(10139,'Ocean\'s Twelve','This heist movie directed by Steven Soderbergh has nothing on its mind except to entertain us with the antics of some talented and competitive men who are drop-outs from regular society. Three years after robbing casino kingpin Terry Benedict, members of the Ocean\'s Eleven gang are told that they have two weeks to pay back — with interest — the millions they took from him. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is living in suburbia with his wife, Tess (Julia Roberts); Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) is in the hotel business; Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) is producing an album; and the others have been off on their own spending money until this unexpected day of reckoning brings them all back together again.\n\nThey gather in Amsterdam to plan a big heist only to find themselves in competition with the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel), Europe\'s top thief, who is being pursued by Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an intrepid Interpol investigator. This rich and self-absorbed man arranges a race to steal the Faberge Coronation Egg from a Rome art museum. Meanwhile, complications ensue when Ocean discovers that Isabel used to be Rusty\'s lover and is not adverse to using him in her own scheme to catch the Night Fox.\n\nEveryone in the movie seems to be having fun, and many bits work well, including a scene where Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) tries to prove that he can move in the same high circle with Danny and Rusty. Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould are funny when they are called upon to be eccentric, and Bruce Willis carries off the humor in an extended cameo involving a visit by the actress Julia Roberts to the Rome art museum. Soderbergh displays a light touch throughout. It\'s a lark to watch this top-drawer cast strutting their stuff in such a playful manner.'),(10140,'THE BIG LEBOWSKI','The Coen brothers\' \"The Big Lebowski\'\' is a genial, shambling comedy about a human train wreck, and should come with a warning like the one Mark Twain attached to \"Huckleberry Finn\'\': \"Persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\'\' It\'s about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is described by the narrator as \"the laziest man in Los Angeles County.\'\' He lives only to go bowling, but is mistaken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with dire consequences.\nThis is the first movie by Joel and Ethan Coen since \"Fargo.\'\' Few movies could equal that one, and this one doesn\'t--but it\'s weirdly engaging, like its hero. The Dude is played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, a potbelly, a ponytail and a pair of Bermuda shorts so large they may have been borrowed from his best friend and bowling teammate, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Their other teammate is Donny (Steve Buscemi), who may not be very bright, but it\'s hard be sure since he never is allowed to complete a sentence.\nEverybody knows somebody like the Dude--and so, rumor has it, do the Coen brothers. They based the character on a movie producer and distributor named Jeff Dowd, a familiar figure at film festivals, who is tall, large, shaggy and aboil with enthusiasm. Dowd is much more successful than Lebowski (he has played an important role in the Coens\' careers as indie filmmakers), but no less a creature of the moment. Both dudes depend on improvisation and inspiration much more than organization.\nIn spirit, \"The Big Lebowski\'\' resembles the Coens\' \"Raising Arizona,\'\' with its large cast of peculiar characters and its strangely wonderful dialogue. Here, in a film set at the time of the Gulf War, are characters whose speech was shaped by earlier times: Vietnam (Walter), the flower power era (the Dude) and \"Twilight Zone\'\' (Donny). Their very notion of reality may be shaped by the limited ways they have to describe it. One of the pleasures of \"Fargo\'\' was the way the Coens listened carefully to how their characters spoke. Here, too, note that when the In & Out Burger shop is suggested for a rendezvous, the Dude supplies its address: That\'s the sort of precise information he would possess.\nAs the film opens, the Dude is visited by two enforcers for a porn king (Ben Gazzara) who is owed a lot of money by the Big Lebowski\'s wife. The goons of course have the wrong Lebowski, but before they figure that out, one already has urinated on the Dude\'s rug, causing deep enmity: \"That rug really tied the room together,\'\' the Dude mourns. Walter, the Viet vet, leads the charge for revenge. Borrowing lines directly from President George Bush on TV, he vows that \"this aggression will not stand\'\' and urges the Dude to \"draw a line in the sand.\'\' The Dude visits the other Lebowski (David Huddleston), leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself enlisted in the millionaire\'s schemes. The rich Lebowski, in a wheelchair and gazing into a fireplace like Maj. Amberson in \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\'\' tells the Dude that his wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), has been kidnapped. He wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. This plan is opposed by Maude (Julianne Moore), the Big Lebowski\'s daughter from an earlier marriage. Moore, who played a porno actress in \"Boogie Nights,\'\' here plays an altogether different kind of erotic artist; she covers her body with paint and hurls herself through the air in a leather harness.\nLos Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he\'s socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.) Some may complain \"The Big Lebowski\'\' rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn\'t the film\'s flaw, but its style. The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings. The spirit is established right at the outset, when the narrator (Sam Elliott) starts out well enough, but eventually confesses he\'s lost his train of thought.'),(10141,'GLADIATOR','It\'s been almost four decades since the last epic sword and sandal flick, Stanley Kubrick\'s \"Spartacus,\" and Ridley Scott, a great visualist (\"Alien,\" \"Blade Runner\") seemed a promising choice to resurrect the genre. While \"Gladiator\" has its merits, it doesn\'t fully return on its hype investment.\n\nThe intense Australian actor Crowe is physically imposing as Maximus, although his intensity translates mostly to dourness here. The film opens as the farmer runs his hand through his golden field of wheat before spying his wife and small son - an image that will echo throughout the movie. Maximus initially refuses to cooperate with his new owner Proximo (the late Oliver Reed), a Gladiator trainer, but impresses with his skills when he\'s put in a fight or die situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Commodus, who wants to squelsh the Senate his father had wished to rule Rome, announces 150 days of games (which his father had outlawed) in the Colliseum in order to win the love of the people. His sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen, \"Mission to Mars\"), who once loved Maximus, appeases her brother only to protect her young son Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).\n\nWhen Maximus and his compatriots enter the Colliseum cast as the Barbarians in the Battle of Carthage they reinvent history by winning an upset victory. Commodore raises his thumb and asks to meet the Spaniard but is aghast to find his foe still alive. Worse, Maximus wins the love of not only Commodus\' people but of his sister Lucilla, whom Commodus lusts after. Lucilla risks all by joining forces with Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi, \"I, Claudius\") and clandestinely meeting with Maximus to plot against her brother.\n\nStandouts in the cast include Joaquin Phoenix, who gives a tortured, tentative performance as the conflicted Commodus, his maturest turn to date. In his last role, Oliver Reed is amazingly restrained and surprisingly likeable. (Reed died during production and one scene features computer trickery to include him.) Richard Harris is an affecting, if unlikely, Aurelius and Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\") is a noble friend to Maximus. Nielsen looks fine as Lucilla but doesn\'t offer much dramatic punch.\n\nScreenwriter William Nicholson emphasizes the spiritual and family in this dark epic. Although there\'s plenty of action, director Scott has oddly chosen murky visual effects combined with tight close up takes of his gladiator bouts which don\'t give the viewer a sense of epic sweep the genre cries out for. The hyper reality effects used in the battle of Germania and tiger fighting sequences played really well in \"Three Kings,\" but are out of place in a film which takes place circa 200 A.D. Computer generated effects and matte shots are too obvious for a film of this caliber. Production design (Arthur Max, \"G.I. Jane\") and costume design (Janty Yates, \"Plunkett & Macleane\") are top notch (although they go a little overboard with a recreation of \"Triumph of the Will\" when Commodus reenters Rome as Emperor). Composer Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance), used so effectively in Crowe\'s previous film \"The Insider,\" disappoints here, giving us pretty Enya-like warbling unsuitable for this story.\n\n\"Gladiator\" gets kudos for attempting to give a fresh face to the genre but it\'s merely a good, not great, film.'),(10142,'ICE AGE','\"Ice Age\" is a pleasure to look at and scarcely less fun as a story. I came to scoff and stayed to smile. I confess the premise did not inspire me: A woolly mammoth, a sabertooth tiger and a sloth team up to rescue a human baby and return it to its parents. Uh, huh. But Peter Ackerman\'s screenplay is sly and literate, and director Chris Wedge\'s visual style so distinctive and appealing that the movie seduced me.\nThe film takes place during a southward migration of species during a great ice age. Such migrations took place over millennia and were not the pre-Cambrian equivalent of going to Florida for the winter months, but no matter: As the ice packs advance, the animals retreat. There is no time to lose. Baby mammoths, playing in a tar pit, are told by their parents to hurry up: \"You can play Extinction later.\" We meet Manfred the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo). Of course they can speak. (It is the humans, they believe, who have not yet mastered language.) When Sid and Manny come upon a small, helpless human child, they decide to protect it and return it to its parents--even though those same parents, they know, have developed weapons for killing them. Along the trail they are joined by Diego the Sabertooth (voiced by Denis Leary), who has a hidden agenda. They are potentially one another\'s dinners, and yet through Sid\'s insouciance and Manny\'s bravery in saving Diego from certain death, they bond and become friends.\nIt is true that altruism is a positive evolutionary trait; a species with individuals willing to die for the survival of the race is a species that will get somewhere in the Darwinian sweepstakes. But listen closely. When Diego the Sabertooth asks Manfred the Mammoth why he saved him, Manny replies, \"That\'s what you do as a herd.\" Yes, absolutely. But herds are by definition made up of members of the same species (and tigers are not herd animals, anyway). If Manny\'s philosophy were to get around in the animal kingdom, evolution would break down, overpopulation would result, there would be starvation among the non-vegetarians, and it would be an ugly picture. Much of the serenity and order of nature depends on eating the neighbors.\n\"Ice Age\" does not preach Darwinian orthodoxy, however, but a kinder, gentler world view: Ice Age meets New Age. And the philosophy scarcely matters, anyway, since this is an animated comedy. Enormous advances have been made in animation technology in recent years, as computers have taken over the detail work and freed artists to realize their visions. But few movies have been as painterly as \"Ice Age,\" which begins with good choices of faces for the characters (note the sabertooth\'s underslung jaw and the sloth\'s outrigger eyes). The landscape is convincing without being realistic, the color palette is harmonious, the character movements include little twists, jiggles, hesitations and hops that create personality. And the animals blossom as personalities.\nThat\'s because of the artwork, the dialogue and the voice-over work by the actors; the filmmakers have all worked together to really see and love these characters, who are not \"cartoon animals\" but as quirky and individual as human actors, and more engaging than most.\nI would suggest the story sneaks up and eventually wins us over, except it starts the winning process in its very first shots, showing a twitchy squirrel desperately trying to bury an acorn in an icy wilderness. We follow the progress of this squirrel all through the picture, as a counterpoint to the main action, and he is such a distinctive, amusing personality I predict he\'ll emerge as the hero of a film of his own.');

The German Albatross Books had pioneered the idea of a line of color-coded paperback editions in 1931 under Kurt Enoch; Penguin Books in Britain had refined the idea in 1935 and had 1 million books in print by the following year.\n\nIn 1944, the founding owners sold the company to Marshall Field III, owner of the Chicago Sun newspaper. Following his death, in 1957, Leon Shimkin, a Simon & Schuster partner, and James M. Jacobson bought Pocket Books. Simon & Schuster acquired Pocket in 1966.\n\nPenguin\'s success inspired entrepreneur Robert de Graff, who partnered with publishers Simon & Schuster to bring it to the American market. Priced at 25 cents and featuring the logo of Gertrude the kangaroo (named after the artist\'s mother-in-law), Pocket Books\' editorial policy of reprints of light literature, popular non-fiction, and mysteries was coordinated with its strategy of selling books outside the traditional distribution channels. The format size, and the fact that the books were glued rather than stitched, were cost-cutting innovations.\n\n'),(2,'William Morrow and Company','William Morrow and Company is an American publishing company founded by William Morrow in 1926.

The publishing house is known for its borzoi colophon (shown at right), which was designed by co-founder Blanche Knopf. Many of its hardcover books later appear as Vintage paperbacks. Vintage is a sister imprint under the Knopf Publishing Group. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Knopf Publishing Group merged with the Doubleday Publishing Group to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group'),(4,'Arthur A. Levine Books','Arthur A.

Giroux brought with him such important writers as T. S. Eliot and Flannery O\'Connor. Straus continued to run the company for twenty years after his partner Farrar died, until 1993 when he sold a majority interest of the company to the privately owned German publishing conglomerate Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.'),(6,'First Second','First Second Books is an American publisher of graphic novels.

INSERT INTO `SHORTREVIEW` VALUES (10001,'One of the best animated films I have ever seen. Great characters, amusing animation, and laugh-out-loud humor. Also, watch for the little skit shown after the credits. It\'s all great stuff that simply must be seen.'),(10002,'This movie is one of the best movies of all time! It has a great story lines and graphics of it\'s time and even to today\'s standards it is brilliant. The world is well though out and well demonstrated. Zorg is a great bad guy, played by Gary Oldman and Bruce Willis plays his role very well. All in all a excellent movie.'),(10003,'A simple enough concept: Guy must save a World (in the Future!) from Evil! by protecting a Magical Macguffin, only in this case it’s a Girl! instead of a Thing.\r\n\r\nThere’s really not a lot of story here. Not a lot of character either. Why waste valuable screen time with such paltry concerns when you can instead have Chris Tucker prancing around as a flamboyant radio host in the most annoying cinematic sci-fi supporting character not created by George Lucas? Instead, the film casts actors who do a fair job of acting simply by being themselves: Bruce Wills is Korben Dallas, a brawny, shoot-first hero who, when the chips are down, is brawny and shoot-firsty. The Magical Girlfriend MacGuffin, Leeloo, is played by Mila Jovovich (in her breakout performance) and some strategically-placed wrappings (the wrappings have had a harder time breaking into more mainstream roles). Ian Holm turns up as the Old Mentor, and filling out the cast is Gary Oldman as the antagonist Zord (in his hammiest role ever).\r\n\r\nThe film seriously rises to the level of made-for-SciFi Channel-original and no higher. The plot is nonsensical, the acting committed but laughable, and the dialogue so stiff you’d think the script pages had been starched.\r\n\r\nSo where does the film go legitimately wrong? Two main places: first, Besson carries on the proud tradition of French filmmakers doing weird things solely for the sake of being weird. The entire film is filled to the brim with the kind of idiosyncratic touches that I’ve come to expect from that region. Most of the bits don’t work, but I’ll give them credit for keeping things interesting.\r\n\r\nThe second, more serious issue is another that seems to plague genre French directors, and that’s the whole matter being played (largely) for farce. The most successful (creatively) American (sci-fi/)action films are defined in very large part by their villain. This film, like so many other sci-fi/action films I’ve seen from French directors, never establish or maintain an element of power for the villains over the heroes. The villains are painted as clueless, moronic, out of their depth, or outright incompetent. That tradition continues here. What would Star Wars be without Darth Vader? Die Hard without Hans Gruber? Aliens without…uh, aliens?\r\n\r\nLacking a strong (or even memorable) central villain (we have two: a Gary Oldman so hammy I’m pretty sure Muslims couldn’t work on the film, and the other being a giant planet-size ball of…Pure!Evil! No joke.), the film sacrifices the one shot it had at having some kind of weight or dimension. There’s no sense of danger or peril, no chance that the Hero won’t triumph, and [spoilers!] the day is essentially saved by a Care Bear stare.\r\n\r\nSo, does what I’ve just said make it bad? Well, yes. Let’s try again. Does that made it unenjoyable? No, and it’s an important distinction to make. The film is an interesting curiosity. After a half-hour of the bizarre, if you can let yourself be swept into its idiosyncratic world you’ll find a perfectly watchable B (or C)-movie. It rankles a bit to think about how much was wasted making dreck this dreck-y, but it’s entertaining dreck.'),(10004,'Gladiator has been my most favorite film of all time. It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting.\r\nAll other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.'),(10005,'Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine'),(10006,'Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is \"the second act\" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.\r\n\r\nPicking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There\'s also the first appearance of Saruman\'s spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here).\r\n\r\nOther newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King.\r\n\r\nAs we\'ve come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm\'s Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen\'s troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film\'s most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It\'s just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true of the Ringbearer\'s quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson\'s desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm\'s Deep, it\'s unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. \r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Caroline Westbrook, Empire Magazine'),(10007,'And so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn\'t be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there\'s the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director\'s thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson\'s roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor\'s evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring\'s power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally \'difficult\' middle part and \'weak\' finale, delivering a climax to the story that\'s neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book\'s Scouring of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine'),(10008,'Being Scottish, this movie really does a good job at showing off the scenery in and around Scotland.

The story and concept are out of this world. Keanu Reeves plays his role with utter brilliance, the cast was very well put together and the graphics are still to this day amazing. All in all one of the best movies of all time.'),(10012,'Get this: what if all we know as reality was, in fact, virtual reality? Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late \'90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?\r\n\r\nWhat sounds like some web freak\'s wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson\'s cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of \"flo-mo\", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean \"talents\" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain\'t.\r\n\r\nImmediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can\'t get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars\' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.\r\n\r\nSure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion\'s share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There\'s a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it\'s been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality. You can bet your bottom dollar George never saw this phantom menace coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Ian Nathan, Empire Magazine'),(10013,'This movie is directed by Robert Rodriquez and has a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino who also has a role in the film. This is actually one of the first movies by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino that I watched and from then on I pretty much became a fan of them both. So, when it came out on Blu-ray a while ago I had to get it for the collection of course.\r\n\r\nWhen I and my dear wife first watched this movie we did not really know what it was all about. We thought it was just another robbery/criminal story and the first half of the movie it is indeed “just” a robbery/criminal story. It is a fairly violent one at that which should be no surprise given who it is that have their fingers in the movie.\r\n\r\nThen half way into the movie everything goes wild when the vampires enter the scene. I remember going “what the f…” when I first saw it since I wasn’t really expecting it to be a vampire movie at all.\r\n\r\nThe movie is quite a rollercoaster ride which bears all the trademarks, in particular lots of bizarre violence, of the Rodriguez/Tarantino couple.

Entertaining A to Z story with high-end Hollywood professional movie making throughout.'),(10015,'More of the same ... but it is not funny any more ...'),(10016,'If it were the first \"Star Wars\" movie, \"The Phantom Menace\" would be hailed as a visionary breakthrough. But this is the fourth movie of the famous series, and we think we know the territory; many of the early reviews have been blase, paying lip service to the visuals and wondering why the characters aren\'t better developed. How quickly do we grow accustomed to wonders. I am reminded of the Isaac Asimov story \"Nightfall,\" about the planet where the stars were visible only once in a thousand years. So awesome was the sight that it drove men mad. We who can see the stars every night glance up casually at the cosmos and then quickly down again, searching for a Dairy Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,\" to cite its full title, is an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking. If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that\'s inevitable: This is the first story in the chronology and has to set up characters who (we already know) will become more interesting with the passage of time. Here we first see Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and R2-D2 and C-3PO. Anakin is only a fresh-faced kid in Episode I; in IV, V and VI, he has become Darth Vader.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of offending devotees of the Force, I will say that the stories of the \"Star Wars\" movies have always been space operas, and that the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. I do not attend with the hope of gaining insights into human behavior. Unlike many movies, these are made to be looked at more than listened to, and George Lucas and his collaborators have filled \"The Phantom Menace\" with wonderful visuals.\r\n\r\nThere are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls, and speakers floating on pods in the center. And other places: the cityscape with the waterfall that has a dizzying descent through space. And the other cities: one city Venetian, with canals, another looking like a hothouse version of imperial Rome, and a third that seems to have grown out of desert sands.\r\n\r\nSet against awesome backdrops, the characters in \"The Phantom Menace\" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained \"Julius Caesar.\" I wish the \"Star Wars\" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal\'s Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn\'t the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.\r\n\r\nThe plot details (of embargoes and blockades) tend to diminish the size of the movie\'s universe--to shrink it to the scale of a 19th century trade dispute. The stars themselves are little more than pinpoints on a black curtain, and \"Star Wars\" has not drawn inspiration from the color photographs being captured by the Hubble Telescope. The series is essentially human mythology, set in space, but not occupying it. If Stanley Kubrick gave us man humbled by the universe, Lucas gives us the universe domesticated by man. His aliens are really just humans in odd skins. For \"The Phantom Menace,\" he introduces Jar Jar Binks, a fully realized computer-animated alien character whose physical movements seem based on afterthoughts. And Jabba the Hutt (who presides over the Podrace) has always seemed positively Dickensian to me.\r\n\r\nYet within the rules he has established, Lucas tells a good story. The key development in \"Phantom\" is the first meeting between the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd)--who is, the Jedi immediately senses, fated for great things. Qui-Gon meets Anakin in a store where he\'s seeking replacement parts for his crippled ship. Qui-Gon soon finds himself backing the young slave in a high-speed Podrace--betting his ship itself against the cost of the replacement parts. The race is one of the film\'s high points, as the entrants zoom between high cliff walls in a refinement of a similar race through metal canyons on a spaceship in \"Star Wars.\" Why is Qui-Gon so confident that Anakin can win? Because he senses an unusual concentration of the Force--and perhaps because, like John the Baptist, he instinctively recognizes the one whose way he is destined to prepare. The film\'s shakiness on the psychological level is evident, however, in the scene where young Anakin is told he must leave his mother (Pernilla August) and follow this tall Jedi stranger. Their mutual resignation to the parting seems awfully restrained. I expected a tearful scene of parting between mother and child, but the best we get is when Anakin asks if his mother can come along, and she replies, \"Son, my place is here.\" As a slave? The discovery and testing of Anakin supplies the film\'s most important action, but in a sense all the action is equally important, because it provides platforms for special-effects sequences. Sometimes our common sense undermines a sequence (for instance, when Jar Jar\'s people and the good guys fight a \'droid army, it becomes obvious that the droids are such bad fighters, they should be returned for a refund). But mostly I was happy to drink in the sights on the screen, in the same spirit that I might enjoy \"Metropolis,\" \"Forbidden Planet,\" \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" \"Dark City\" or \"The Matrix.\" The difference is that Lucas\' visuals are more fanciful and his film\'s energy level is more cheerful; he doesn\'t share the prevailing view that the future is a dark and lonely place.\r\n\r\nWhat he does have, in abundance, is exhilaration. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of \"The Phantom Menace,\" as he tries out new effects and ideas, and seamlessly integrates real characters and digital ones, real landscapes and imaginary places. We are standing at the threshold of a new age of epic cinema, I think, in which digital techniques mean that budgets will no longer limit the scope of scenes; filmmakers will be able to show us just about anything they can imagine.\r\n\r\nAs surely as Anakin Skywalker points the way into the future of \"Star Wars,\" so does \"The Phantom Menace\" raise the curtain on this new freedom for filmmakers. And it\'s a lot of fun. The film has correctly been given the PG rating; it\'s suitable for younger viewers and doesn\'t depend on violence for its effects. As for the bad rap about the characters--hey, I\'ve seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. They\'re called \"Star Trek\" movies. Give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day.\r\n\r\n3.5/4\r\n\r\n-Rodger Ebert'),(10017,'Good'),(10018,'George Lucas comes full circle in more ways than one in \"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith,\" which is the sixth -- and allegedly but not necessarily the last -- of the \"Star Wars\" movies. After \"Episode II\" got so bogged down in politics that it played like the Republic covered by C-Span, \"Episode III\" is a return to the classic space opera style that launched the series. Because the story leads up to where the original \"Star Wars\" began, we get to use the immemorial movie phrase, \"This is where we came in.\"\r\n\r\nThat Anakin Skywalker abandoned the Jedi and went over to the dark side is known to all students of \"Star Wars.\" That his twins Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia would redeem the family name is also known. What we discover in \"Episode III\" is how and why Anakin lost his way -- how a pleasant and brave young man was transformed into a dark, cloaked figure with a fearsome black metal face. As Yoda sadly puts it in his inimitable word order: \"The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.\"\r\n\r\nAs \"Episode III\" opens, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are piloting fighter craft, staging a daring two-man raid to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). He has been captured by the rebel Gen. Grievous (whose voice, by Matthew Woods, sounds curiously wheezy considering the general seems to use replacement parts). In the spirit of all the \"Star Wars\" movies, this rescue sequence flies in the face of logic, since the two pilots are able to board Grievous\' command ship and proceed without much trouble to the ship\'s observation tower, where the chancellor is being held. There is a close call in an elevator shaft, but where are the guards and the security systems? And why, for that matter, does a deep space cruiser need an observation tower, when every porthole opens on to the universe? But never mind.\r\n\r\nBack within the sphere of the Jedi Council, Anakin finds that despite his heroism, he will not yet be named a Jedi Master. The council distrusts Palpatine and wants Anakin to spy on him; Palpatine wants Anakin to spy on the council. Who to choose? McDiarmid has the most complex role in the movie as he plays on Anakin\'s wounded ego. Anakin is tempted to go over to what is not yet clearly the dark side; in a movie not distinguished for its dialogue, Palpatine is insidiously snaky in his persuasiveness.\r\n\r\nThe way Anakin approaches his choice, however, has a certain poignancy. Anakin has a rendezvous with Padme (Natalie Portman); they were secretly married in the previous film, and now she reveals she is pregnant. His reaction is that of a nice kid in a teenage comedy, trying to seem pleased while wondering how this will affect the other neat stuff he gets to do. To say that George Lucas cannot write a love scene is an understatement; greeting cards have expressed more passion.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point: The characters talk in what sounds like Basic English, without color, wit or verbal delight, as if they were channeling Berlitz. The exceptions are Palpatine and of course Yoda, whose speech (voiced by Frank Oz) reminds me of Wolcott Gibbs\' famous line about the early style of Time magazine: \"Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.\"\r\n\r\nIn many cases the actors are being filmed in front of blue screens, with effects to be added later, and sometimes their readings are so flat, they don\'t seem to believe they\'re really in the middle of amazing events. How can you stand in front of exploding star fleets and sound as if you\'re talking on a cell phone at Starbucks?\r\n\r\n\"He\'s worried about you,\" Anakin is told at one point. \"You\'ve been under a lot of stress.\" Sometimes the emphasis in sentences is misplaced. During the elevator adventure in the opening rescue, we hear \"Did I miss something?\" when it should be \"Did I miss something?\"\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is not the point, however; Lucas\' characters engage in sturdy oratorical pronunciamentos and then leap into adventure. \"Episode III\" has more action per square minute, I\'d guess, than any of the previous five movies, and it is spectacular. The special effects are more sophisticated than in the earlier movies, of course, but not necessarily more effective.\r\n\r\nThe dogfight between fighters in the original \"Star Wars\" and the dogfight that opens this one differ in their complexity (many more ships this time, more planes of action, more detailed backgrounds) but not in their excitement. And although Lucas has his characters attend a futuristic opera that looks like a cross between Cirque de Soleil and an ultrasound scan of an unborn baby, if you regard the opera hall simply as a place, it\'s not as engaging as the saloon on Tatooine in the first movie.\r\n\r\nThe lesson, I think, is that special effects should be judged not by their complexity but by the degree that they stimulate the imagination, and \"Episode III\" is distinguished not by how well the effects are done, but by how amazingly they are imagined. A climactic duel on a blazing volcanic planet is as impressive, in its line, as anything in \"Lord of the Rings.\" And Yoda, who began life as a Muppet but is now completely animated (like about 70 percent of what we see onscreen), was to begin with and still is the most lifelike of the non-humanoid \"Star Wars\" characters.\r\n\r\nA word, however, about the duels fought with lightsabers. When they flashed into life with a mighty whizzing thunk in the first \"Star Wars\" and whooshed through their deadly parabolas, that was exciting. But the thrill is gone.\r\n\r\nThe duelists are so well-matched that saber fights go on forever before anyone is wounded, and I am still not sure how the sabers seem able to shield their bearers from attack. When it comes to great movie sword fights, Liam Neeson and Tim Roth took home the gold medal in \"Rob Roy\" (1995), and the lightsaber battles in \"Episode III\" are more like isometrics.\r\n\r\nThese are all, however, more observations than criticisms. George Lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own. His \"Star Wars\" movies are among the most influential, both technically and commercially, ever made. And they are fun. If he got bogged down in solemnity and theory in \"Episode II: Attack of the Clones,\" the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and \"Revenge of the Sith\" is a great entertainment.\r\n\r\nNote: I said this is not necessarily the last of the \"Star Wars\" movies. Although Lucas has absolutely said he is finished with the series, it is inconceivable to me that 20th Century-Fox will willingly abandon the franchise, especially as Lucas has hinted that parts VII, VIII and IX exist at least in his mind. There will be enormous pressure for them to be made, if not by him, then by his deputies.\r\n\r\n4.5/5\r\n\r\n- Rodger Ebert'),(10019,'“The Amazing Spider-Man” has no reason to exist. Spider-man is a hero everyone knows. He´s been around for so long everyone is familiar with his origin, comic fan or not. Its basic pop culture. Then you have the Sam Raimi´s movies. Everyone saw them. They made loads of money and they´re always on tv. They are entertaining movies. “Spider-Man” gave us a good origin story in 2002. This movie simply wasn\'t needed. \r\nNow I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There´s Burton´s Batman and Nolan´s. Maybe this was a different Spider-Man. A more “dark” vision perhaps! Maybe the movie spent a few minutes on the origin and then wisely moved on with its story. Maybe... well maybe it wasn\'t just another rehash. A shameless attempt to remake, or how they say it these days, reboot the same idea with minimal changes except the cast. I was naive.\r\nThe whole movie is about Spider-Man´s origin. They traded Mary Jane for another love interest and held off on “The Green Goblin” because that would be too much “rubbing it in the face” for the fans, I guess. We get Gwen Stacy and “The Lizard”. The rest is same old, same old. The same uncle Ben plot, the same scenes about making the suit, learning how to control powers, the search for the criminal Spider-man lets get away with horrific results. Same thing. Except everything is done without a spark of energy or creativity. Raimi´s movies were energetic, flowing with excitement. They were “new”. Seeing Spider-Man on the big screen,  webbing all over the city, fighting “The Green Goblin”, it was amazing. We didn\'t have “The Avengers” back there, or “Iron Man”. This was like a dream come true for comic fans. \r\n“The Amazing Spider-Man” smells of old cheese. \r\nI tried to take the movie for what it was but it was impossible. My mind would not let me. I knew what was going to happen next. I knew all the plots! I´d seen it all before! \r\nBut even ignoring that the movie just does not work. Its slow, turgid with an unlikable Peter Parker and a CGI lizard for a villain. Parker is a whiny, self centered idiot. His relationship with aunt May and uncle Ben is never fully explored and what little there is consists of Parker being a rude jerk for no reason at all. \r\nThe movie has one thing going for it. The cast. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are great with what little material they have. Emma Stone is sexy and sweet which is “her thing” and again she pulls it off brilliantly.  Rhys Ifans is decent as Curt Connors and surprisingly enough I loved Andrew Garfield as Spidey. Yes, seriously! He looks perfect for the part and he did his best with the horrible script. He´s charismatic and brought his own touch to the role instead of copying Toby Maguire. If the movie is even slightly original its because of him. \r\nSome of the action in the last third of the movie is also spectacular. Spider-man´s movements when fighting are really well done as is the web-slinging. The action is well directed and exciting and the movie sets up a sequel rather nicely. \r\nBut its asking a lot to go over the material everyone knows for two hours for a few minutes of cool action. The movie plays it so safe it hurts. Its competent but never brilliant. Tedious but far too long with little spots of action but few and far between. \r\nI hope in the sequel this “Spider-Man” can find its own style and its own place. Given space to grow and evolve, on the strength of the character and Garfield´s acting this could be the weak start to a new amazing super-hero trilogy. \r\nThen again, maybe i´m just naive.'),(10020,'The movie could be about anything and I would like it.

I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.\r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth.

In het Witte Huis wordt duidelijk dat het schema van Adrian sneller verloopt dan ze dachten, en dat door de grote hitte van de aardkern de mantel ook vloeibaarder is geworden, waardoor de aardkorst als het ware \"los\" kan drijven, en dus zal gaan verschuiven. Ook krijgen ze te horen dat er maar 4 arken op tijd klaar zullen zijn. Jackson wordt opgeroepen als chauffeur om de zoons van de Russische miljardair Yuri Karpov op te halen en ze naar het vliegveld te brengen. Hier laat één van de zoons per ongeluk los dat zij de rampen zullen overleven en Jackson niet. Met de informatie die Jackson al van Charlie kreeg, realiseert hij zich dat er inderdaad rampzalige dingen zullen gaan gebeuren, en hij rijdt terug naar L.A. om z\'n familie op te halen. Hij gebruikt een vliegtuig en Gordon, die amateurpiloot is, is uiteindelijk gedwongen het vliegtuig te besturen wanneer hun piloot blijkt te zijn omgekomen. Terwijl ze opstijgen is de familie Curtis getuige van de complete verwoesting van Los Angeles. De stad verdwijnt door de aardkorstverschuiving volledig in de Stille Oceaan.\r\nIn het Witte Huis wordt Adrian verteld dat de aardkorstverschuiving voor honderden aardbevingen heeft gezorgd en al 2 miljoen slachtoffers heeft geëist. President Wilson geeft het bevel dat zijn personeel zo snel mogelijk het vliegtuig in moet om naar China te vertrekken, waar de ruimteschepen liggen. Hij onthult ook aan Adrian dat hij zelf niet mee zal gaan, omdat iemand de rest van de wereld op de hoogte zal moeten brengen van de komende rampen die tot het einde van de wereld zullen leiden. De president vindt dat hijzelf daar de aangewezen persoon voor is. Adrian gaat vervolgens met Anheuser en andere personeelsleden aan boord van een Air Force One. Jackson beseft intussen dat als ze het willen overleven, ze de locatie van de schepen moeten zien te achterhalen. Hij overtuigt Gordon er daarom van om naar Yellowstone te vliegen en Charlie te vinden, om zo de locatie van de \"ruimteschepen\" te achterhalen. Terwijl Gordon het vliegtuig bijvult met brandstof, gaat Jackson op zoek naar Charlie en vindt hem. Hij vertelt dat de kaart in zijn camper ligt. Jackson weet net op tijd weg te komen als de vulkaan onder Yellowstone plotseling uitbarst. De familie ontsnapt met het vliegtuig net op tijd aan de aswolken. Jackson ontdekt op de kaart dat ze naar China moeten en ze landen uiteindelijk in Las Vegas om nieuwe brandstof te tanken. Hier lopen ze Yuri en z\'n gezin tegen het lijf. Hun vliegtuig is gecrasht. Yuri\'s piloot Sascha neemt vervolgens een oude Antonov An-225 over, maar heeft een co-piloot nodig, waardoor de familie Curtis en Gordon mee kunnen. Ze willen landen in Hawaï om meer brandstof te tanken, maar ontdekken dat Hawaï volledig is veranderd in een vulkanisch gebied. Ze zijn gedwongen verder te vliegen. Sascha voorspelt dat ze binnen 15 minuten in de Stille Oceaan zullen neerstorten. Wanneer hij door de wolken heen is, ziet hij dat waar de oceaan zou moeten zijn, een grote ijsmassa te vinden is. Jackson realiseert zich dat de aardkorstverschuivingstheorie werkelijk bestaat. Ze storten neer op een gletsjer waarbij Sascha omkomt. Vervolgens worden ze gevonden door Chinese troepen, die bezig zijn dieren over te brengen naar de schepen. De soldaten nemen Yuri en z\'n kinderen mee wanneer hij zijn tickets laat zien. Daardoor blijven de familie Curtis, Gordon en Yuri\'s vriendin Tamara (die geen ticket had) achter. In China, bij de schepen, wordt duidelijk dat van één van de arken het dak is ingestort door de aardkorstverschuiving en wordt het Laura en Adrian duidelijk dat de passagiers helemaal niet op basis van DNA en wetenschap zijn gekozen, maar dat rijke mensen hun toegang hebben kunnen kopen: zij hebben per ticket 1 miljard euro neergeteld. Adrian wordt vervolgens door zijn Indiase collega opgebeld met de mededeling dat India op het punt staat overspoeld te worden door een gigantische tsunami. Hierdoor beseft Adrian dat de tsunami hen eerder zal bereiken dan gepland, en dat ze op moeten schieten. Wanneer Anheuser dit hoort, maakt hij de beslissing de poorten van de schepen eerder te sluiten, waardoor tienduizenden mensen, onder wie Yuri en zijn zoons, buitengesloten worden.\r\nJackson en z\'n familie worden intussen opgepikt door een Tibetaanse monnik die op weg is naar de schepen om aan boord te gaan. Ze worden door diens broer aan boord gesmokkeld van een ark via de machinekamer en Jackson beseft dat de schepen geen ruimteschepen maar arken zijn. Ze komen vast te zitten wanneer de poorten weer zakken op bevel van Adrian, die de buitengesloten mensen toch wil binnenlaten. Gordon wordt tussen de tandwielen geslingerd en overlijdt, en tegelijk komt ook een drilboor vast te zitten tussen de motoren, waardoor de poort niet meer volledig kan sluiten. Yuri weet z\'n kinderen net op tijd aan boord te krijgen, maar valt vervolgens zelf van het platform en sterft. Nu de poort niet meer volledig sluit, kan de bemanning de motoren niet starten. De tsunami komt al snel hun kant op en water begint de ark binnen te stromen, waarna de passagiers benedendeks door het water waden. Jackson en z\'n gezin worden gesplitst doordat waterbestendige deuren sluiten. Daardoor komen zij in verschillende compartimenten terecht. Adrian ziet via de camera\'s dat Jackson aan boord is weten te komen en haast zich naar de compartimenten om hem en zijn familie te redden. Tamara, die alleen zit, verdrinkt al snel wanneer het water te hoog komt. Jackson hoort van Adrian dat de compartimenten alleen maar open kunnen gaan wanneer de boor uit de motoren wordt gehaald en het hele systeem weer werkt. Met hulp van z\'n zoontje Noah weet Jackson dit voor elkaar te krijgen. De poort sluit weer zodat de motoren kunnen worden gestart en een botsing met de Mount Everest ternauwernood wordt voorkomen. Jackson en z\'n familie maar ook de monniken worden bevrijd, en Jackson en Kate herenigen zich.\r\n27 dagen later (datum: \"27ste dag van de eerste maand, jaar 0001\") krijgen de arken de eerste satellietfoto binnen, waaruit duidelijk wordt dat Afrika het enige continent is dat niet volledig is overstroomd. Het ligt nu zelfs hoger, waardoor de Drakensbergen nu de hoogste bergen ter wereld zijn. Uit metingen wordt duidelijk dat de lucht weer enigszins schoon is en dat de poorten van de arken kunnen worden geopend. Daardoor kan de mensheid voor het eerst sinds de overstroming weer naar buiten.'),(10026,'Where do you start with Tron: Legacy? It’s a sequel to a minor cult hit that arrived in theaters 28 years ago, a film more renown for its (at the time) state-of-the-art design than its coherent story or classic characters, rekindled now not as a reboot or remake, but as a direct sequel to that long-ago work.\r\n\r\nTron\'s esteem may have grown in the intervening years (much the same fate as another maligned-at-the-time science fiction film, Blade Runner), but time has been mostly unkind to it; Disney attempted to stage a run of pre-LEGACY screenings of the original film, but modern audiences greeted its dated appeal as unintentionally hilarious. Frightened by the impact this might have had on their $170 million spectacle, they pulled plans for a theatrical release, and whisked the recent 25th anniversary DVD off of store shelves. And so, bereft of a childhood that contained Tron, I went into the sequel with naught but a Wikipedia plot breakdown (which was, to be honest, frustratingly informative) to fill in what turned out to be largely irrelevant narrative gaps. I say that to say that I am reviewing Legacy solely for Legacy\'s sake, untainted by nostalgia or high expectations.\r\n\r\nMore than two decades after the events of the first film (which, for the uninitiated, involve a computer programmer [Jeff Bridges, reprising his role] being zapped from the physical world into the computer world he created and fighting an oppressive digital tyrant within), we’re introduced to that computer programmer’s twenty-something kid, heir to his father’s tech empire and not terribly happy about it. It seems he’s still hung up on his father’s mysterious disappearance long ago, and a mysterious message leads to him discovering Dear Old Dad’s secret underground lab, where he’s accidentally zapped into the digital world as well. I’m afraid I’m not spoiling anything to go ahead and say that within he finds his trapped father, and they must fight their way back out. To give more plot details would be unfair and pointless. Suffice to say that once within the digital realm, it becomes action beat after action beat wherein our young hero rescues dad and his requisite romantic interest until the film ends.\r\n\r\nOh sure, there are good guys, and there are bad guys, and there’s a token stab at depth, but what does it matter? That digital world looks really cool, right? And that’s why we go. The sad truth of the matter, however, is that what looks awesome in a two-minute trailer begins to wear on the eyes when presented long-form. “The Grid” exists in three colors: neon blue, neon orange, and black. Well, two colors and an absence of color, I suppose. As nifty as this may seem, two-plus hours of this (particularly at the reduced light offered by 3D projection) robs it of interest, and the whole thing becomes a dull slog. 3D works by enhancing depth, but little to no depth is present when the film is lit and shot in such a stylized manner. To boot, only the bad guys are orange. And as our audience proxy characters are good, we’re robbed even of the contrasting orange to break up the monotony.\r\n\r\nThere are some neat sequences, of course: the initial lightcycle battle, a digital dogfight later on, etc. Garret Hedlund and Oliva Wilde are perfectly fine in their frankly bland roles, and Jeff Bridges squeezes what depth he can into his dual characters (actual Kevin Flynn and his twenty-years-younger digital duplicate, thanks to some unnerving but nifty visual trickery). The film is far from the unwatchable dreck of, say, The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader. It’s just...not very interesting. Techno group Daft Punk’s score was easily the best part of the film, and something I’d actually recommend picking up with no hesitations. At its best, the Daft Punk score and stylized imagery (early in the film, before it wears you down) do provide a unique and imaginative experience. It’s just one fit for the length of a music video, not a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut let’s not kid ourselves: Tron: Legacy is a flashy, ridiculous spectacle that exists solely to put pretty pictures onscreen for two hours and drive a $4+ 3D surcharge. And I say that with no judgment. Some films simply are what they are, and you’ve no more right to expect a dog to meow than to glean from them deep meditations on the human condition. The history of cinema is full of this kind of shallow but aloofly entertaining distraction. But is it wrong to want more of these kinds of films? Take Star Wars, for instance: its strength lies mainly in its revolutionary aesthetic and special effects, but it’s the characters that we remember from the film, not just how cool some set-piece looked. And Lucas isn’t even a terribly good writer; the strength of his characters came from that universal pull all great archetypes have, that ability for audience identification and empathy. Will the name Sam Flynn have the same kind of longevity? What about...uh, Oliva Wilde’s character? Apparently not, at least for me. (Note: IMDb says it’s “Quorra.”) If nostalgia for the first film is strong for you, or you’ve no qualms about paying $14+ for a mildly-distracting if uninvolving experience, go for it. Everyone else may as well save themselves the money. Maybe catch it on Blu-ray.\r\n\r\nI should note, though, that I can honestly say 3D added nothing to the experience, so if you want to be able to actually see in The Grid, save yourself the money and hop into a 2D seat.'),(10027,'With a movie like this you wonder how all of the otherwise, main characters will work together and support the story.\r\n\r\nNo problems here.  While as might be expected, R. Downey Jr. comes across largely central, it is still a good mix and IMHO the best scenes in the movie involve the generated Hulk character.\r\n\r\nWith that kind of successful melding of characters, Hollywood-scale egos and even computer generated characters; you have to give it up to the writers and director to make this the successful film that it is.'),(10028,'As bad as the rest of the saga.\r\n\r\nTons of action and FX with brainless script and plenty of bad actors.'),(10029,'Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie, it was one of my all time favourites. Unlike Quantum of Solace, I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.\r\n\r\nSomething I found interesting is the idea about Bond getting old and how the job of an MI6 agent is not something you can do forever. It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.\r\n\r\nIt\'s true that the last 1/3 of Skyfall didn\'t feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that\'s why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a different look at James Bond and Skyfall was no exception.\r\n\r\nLike I said, great movie. Execution on all accounts were solid like you\'d expect. I hope Mendes gets a chance to do the next film.'),(10030,'Skyfall is a great movie. In my opinion the best proformas by Daniel Craig I have see in all his Bond movies. The title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. The story line is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Silva, played by Javier Bardem was excellent and he played him very well. All in all a very good movie.'),(10031,'Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 154 minutes long, so Wiki tells me (although whilst watching it it felt as though it flew by in a mere, ooh, fourteen hours or so?). 154 minutes. And I was lost, bored and checking my watch before the fourth minute. So I shall attempt to review a movie I have only just seen but about which I know almost nothing, and about which I care considerably less than that. The following will be far less a coherent review than a disjointed mess. Well, fine. Seems perfectly apt.\r\n\r\nSo, years ago, the old Autobot leader Sentinel Prime crashed into the moon along with some teleporter doowacky - made up of hundreds of \"pillars\" - that only he can control. The Decepticons swiped almost all the pillars but left Sentinel there. On a routine military... um... I\'m not sure; Jolly Boy\'s Outing? Optimus Prime gets into a fracas with Decepticon Shockwave and finds a couple of these pillars. He then throws a strop \'cos the humans knew about this bit of Cybertron kit but never told him, but now they\'re more than happy to, I suppose. Um. So Optimus rocks up to the moon and finds Sentinel Prime and revives him. Turns out this is what the Decepticons wanted; only Optimus could revive him and only Sentinel can work the teleporter doowacky (the \"Bridge\"). So now they\'re after Sentinel. But OH NOES, Sentinel has decided that the Autobots are fighting a lost cause, so he\'s throwing in with the Decepticons anyway. Cue lots of deeply confusing and tedious \"Tranny-Slapping\" as I have just dubbed the Transformer skirmishes as Megatron, Sentinel and the baddies try to use the Bridge to... um, pull their faraway home of Cybertron to Earth? Or turn Earth into Cybertron? Or something.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sam Witwicky* (Shia LaBeouf, even more punchable than usual, which by his standards is quite something) is not just a useless nerd this time around, he\'s also a whingeing **** who wants a) international acclaim and credit (other than the medal awarded him by the president of course!) for his part in saving the world twice even though nobody knows that that\'s what he\'s done, and b) a 40-hour job. Anything really; Trolley-dolly at Asda/Walmart will be fine. Despite all this he seems to have effortlessly brushed off Megan Fox and continued to punch way, way above his weight with his new squeeze, Rosie DoubleBarrelled-Surname: English, impossibly attractive, permanently dressed for all occasions - work, play, sleep, dragging her ****hole across the carpet like a worm-ridden doggie - like a $200-an-hour prostitute, and, incredibly, at least 40% stupider even than Ms. Fox, who as we know is marginally less alert and responsive than a squeezed tube of Anusol. How does Sam fit in to the so-called \"plot\"? Who knows. Double-Barrelled\'s smarmy, supercar-distributing walking hard-on of a boss turns out to be a Decepticon bitch (Deceptibitch?), and... oh, Christ knows. Alls I DO know is that this time around, Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have joined John Turturro in shilling for dollars like a ****-flashing strumpet. \"Me so shaaaameless.\" \"Me overact LONG time!\" \"Me so shaaaameless.\" Sucky-f*cky, five million dollar?\r\n\r\nFrom the very first second to the very last, the whole thing is needlessly convoluted, comically unfeasible - even within its own logic, such as that is - and most crucially, lifeforce-sappingly dull. Just like the other two movies, and of course just like the Transformers themselves. At one point, maybe two-thirds in (or maybe seven weeks in, who knows?), the angsty, poignant strains of a generic rock ballad signalled the arrival of a \"sad\" scene. On-screen, people crouched and clasped their heads in anguish, weeping and hugging in amongst considerable swathes of burning scenery and unspecifiable wreckage. I\'m not sure why this bit was to be considered sad or poignant; perhaps the entire cast simultaneously realised they were in a Transformers movie.\r\n\r\nAwful, awful. As bad as anything Bay has ever shat out during his spiteful, cynical, moviegoer-hating and barely-disguised subterfuge as a \"film director\".'),(10032,'Lasseter is smart enough to tell us a completely different story than in the first movie. However, it is far from other titles like \"Toy Story\" or \"The Incredibles\".'),(10033,'I felt like this was a tremendous end to Nolan\'s Batman trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you\'re talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I\'ve seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn\'t find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms—it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same \'as-close-to-perfect\' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan\'s other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don\'t have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect.'),(10034,'I personally thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.\r\n\r\nWhilst some think the film is too long for the story I didn\'t find this. The length of the film is longer than some (but doesn\'t feel it), I liked that the film took it\'s time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman series so far.\r\n\r\nStupendously good film in my opinion.'),(10035,'The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of, I my opinion, the best bad guys in any movie, Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended).'),(10036,'Arguably the best Bourne film to-date.

This movie was an excellent example of how great actors, an amazing story and a beautiful world can be produced in such an excellent way. Peter Jackson has out done his self by creating this great film. There are differences from the book but I can\'t complain about any of them, yes I love the original story but this one is still one of the best. All in all a amazing movie.'),(10040,'Over a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien\'s seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings, the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien\'s tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film, with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon\'s critically-acclaimed, audience-adored multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous for a go-round with Tolkien\'s earlier work, The Hobbit.\r\n\r\nTolkien\'s The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.\r\n\r\nJackson had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up/lead-in with the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit, taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film\'s framing sequence (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring), along with that trilogy\'s star, Elijah Wood. But this time out, it\'s Freeman\'s show, and he\'s as charming, witty, and engaging as you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version) and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the third of this film\'s main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves. Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to shine.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit affair: the fact that it\'s a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of the Rings\' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of a whopping three hours. And as anyone who\'s seen The Return of the King can attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film). Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent. I\'m an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain: I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film. It\'s astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines \"taking the scenic route,\" but the crazy thing is I didn\'t mind it in the least. I believe it\'s because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy\'s \"save the world\" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around Frodo\'s neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn\'t have the weight of the world on its shoulders. It\'s rather the difference between having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely have a dire impact on the film\'s rewatchability, but sitting in the theater for a midnight showing? Magic.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the film itself seems to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can\'t stress enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn\'t mind in the least (with one exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell will stop a film dead in its tracks).\r\n\r\nThe craft of the film manages to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights (distracting and ugly).\r\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is Jackon\'s newfound over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they\'re fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis\' performance and the CGI truly sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and if this is any indication of things to come, I\'ll most assuredly enjoy the ride.'),(10041,'Overall this movie is great! It has flaws but it still delivered.  For instance, they didn\'t really explore the loving side of Superman that is the reason for saving humans.  But i get it that this could just be a different interpretation of his motives. The relationship between Clark and Lois was almost spontaneous and didn\'t really develop. Not to mention there was so much action! Sure this is Superman and he deserves a big movie, but that action is just so mind numbing and distracts from the plot. I really did like how they explored Clarks childhood just enough to give justification to his emotions. Although there are criticism about the ending, I thought it was well made. Clark spent his entire youth listening to his father to control himself and he had to learn to make a tough decision. I think this movie has a lot of potential for a sequel if they do it right. I look forward to being able to look back on this and watch it as part of a trilogy and not a stand alone film.'),(10042,'Totally forgettable and full of stereotypes'),(10043,'A very good movie!\r\nI\'m not a massive comic book reader/fan and when I watched the first couple of the X-men movies I always wondered how it all begin and this movie do it justice! The actors where great (there no Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen), Kevin Bacon played the baddie very well and was well suited for it and it was graphically impressive.\r\nLoved to see the development of the characters over the duration of the film.\r\nIn all, I think it was a excellent movie.'),(10044,'I didn\'t love this movie. There were aspects about it from the perspective of an origin story that were interesting but something about the pacing and acting just felt… off. I can\'t quite put my finger on it but the first word that comes to mind is \"campy\". Kind of like I was watching one of the last three Star Wars movies. The dialog and overall tone just weren\'t serious enough.\r\n\r\nThe trailer for [X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/127585-x-men-days-of-future-past) looks better and Bryan Singer is back at the helm. The best X-Men movies are without a doubt 1 & 2 so here\'s hoping he can steer this back a bit.'),(10045,'It may seem that this movie is totally a soap opera but it is actually a terrific adaption of the original novel with good performances from the cast.\r\n\r\nAnother question would be what kind of story we were expecting: teenagers oriented, hyper melodramatic, cheese and quite often stupid and with no sense whatsoever. Exactly as the original novel.'),(10046,'The second part amends the fiasco of the first one.\r\n\r\nSpectacular and, again, with several moments of the already classic \"platform-like\" fights on the run from these series of movies that could be enhanced if some sense would be given to them. Still, the staging of every location and, remarkably, Smaug, is worth seeing.'),(10047,'movie was a little slow and drawn out.  action was ok but story was little weak.'),(10048,'I am normally fairly hesitant concerning time-travel movies because it is next to impossible to get them right. They more or less always become very unrealistic and full of paradoxes. I would almost go as far as to say that producers making serious (non-comedy) time travel movies are the ones that are scientifically too stupid to realise that it is just going to be a mess, or they do not really care about the issues hoping that the audience also will not care.\r\n\r\nThis movie is really proof of this. It is full of paradoxes and annoying “but if this happened now then that couldn’t have happened then and vice versa”. Maybe some people can force themselves overlooking these things but I have some difficulty doing so. I fully agree with the statement that one of the characters in the movie was making: “\"This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg…\".\r\n\r\nAnyway, trying to pierce through the cloud of time-travel issues and enjoy the movie, it is not a bad movie. Given that it really had no chance of succeeding in the science area, or have a plot which didn’t defy all logic (time travel you know) it does indeed make a valiant try to entertain. It is not one of Bruce Willies standard all-out action-filled roller-coasters. That is not to say that there is no action but there is also plenty of time for trying to actually tell the story in the movie. The movie is actually quite dark and melancholic. The future seems to be fairly dirty, run down and ridden with criminal organisations.\r\n\r\nAs if time-travel itself wasn’t bad enough the story also involves 10% of the population having developed psychic powers. Most of them good for nothing except cheap show tricks like levitating small objects. Most of them…except our future crime lord which of course is found to have super-psychic powers. Also, of course, the kid had to behave like a spoiled brat with anger problems which was somewhat annoying.\r\n\r\nThe ending, which I will not divulge here of course, was not very surprising and left quite a few open questions. On the whole I would say that the movie was entertaining but it is far from going on my top ten list.'),(10049,'The plot is full of flaws.

Stuff just seemed to happen.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and this isn\'t as much the movies fault as perhaps the marketing that surrounded it, but it was actually a very different movie than I thought it was going to be. I discovered that it\'s hard to break those pre-conceptions as I kept thinking the story was going somewhere else than it did.\r\n\r\nBrave was at its best when it made me laugh which  unfortunately, was just too seldom. For example, the entire scene where the 3 clans try to fight for Mérida\'s hand was way too short!\r\n\r\nThe voice cast was very good though. Kelly Macdonald in particular, was perfect as Mérida.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Brave was good but not great. It just seems to lack the \"magic\" I expect from Pixar.

Two horsebacked slave-traders are leading half-a-dozen manacled negro slaves through a large, unspecified section of Texas. As they move one night through a wood, they cross paths with an affable, charming German fellow identified by the hokey model tooth affixed atop his carriage by a spring as a travelling dentist. He greets the traders cordially but he\'s struggling to be understood; not because English is his second language (although he deferentially concedes as much when instructed - more than once - to \"Speak English!\") but because his vocabulary is far wider than that of the simpler men here before him. It\'s not a chance passing, either; this German fellow, who identifies himself as Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling, deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds) is looking for these traders. More specifically, their inventory of negro slaves. Even more specifically, one of those slaves in particular. Django (Jamie Foxx, Collateral, Ray). Attempting to buy Django, Schultz is met with short, suspicious shrift and ordered at gunpoint to be on his way. Within a second, one trader lies dead and the other lies incapacitated underneath the bulk of his dead horse. Schultz unchains Django, instructs Django to take the dead fellow\'s horse and coat, and pays the remaining trader for all that he\'s taken. He then tosses the manacle key to the other slaves and posits two choices to them, as he sees it: Carry their injured master thirty-plus miles to the nearest town for medical assistance, or unchain themselves, blow the injured slave-trader\'s head off with the gun Shultz has left them, bury the corpses and use the Pole Star to run for the Northern states, where slavery had been abolished, and for more than fifty years in some areas. Funnily enough, they take up the latter option.\r\n\r\nSo begins Django Unchained, an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by Gen-X movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino. Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western, he\'s finally made one himself, and if Quentin\'s your thing it\'s a blast, though I doubt it\'ll convert many Tarantino sceptics; in fact it\'ll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him, about which more later.\r\n\r\nIt transpires that Dr. Schultz ISN\'T a dentist (\"I haven\'t practised dentistry in five years,\" he confides to Django over a beer) but a bounty hunter, and a lethal one at that. He\'s chasing down the Brittles, a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers. He doesn\'t know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation, which is why he was searching for Django - a slave recently sold by that very plantation - in the first place; Django can point them out for him. Schultz is no fan of the South\'s backwards-thinking propensity for slavery though, and he offers Django a deal: help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz will treat Django like a free man, pay him $75 (a decent little wedge in 1858) and rubber-stamp his freedom. Along the way, he\'ll also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bounty-hunting (both in which Django proves to be a natural). On the trail of the Brittles, Schultz wonders aloud as to Django\'s plans once this endeavour is over and he\'s free. Well, as it happens, Django is a married man and his intention, once free, is to find his wife and buy her freedom. They\'d tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but they\'d been caught, branded (both Django and his wife - played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington - sport R-For-Runaway scars on their cheeks) and sold on, separately. So he doesn\'t know where she is but that\'s what he\'s going to try to do. Schultz, feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom, proposes a further deal: If this Brittle bounty goes well, he\'ll honour Django\'s freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners, taking on bounties and earning money, he\'ll help Django locate his wife.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a large sequence of set-pieces - some funny, some tense, some action-packed - stretched across very-nearly three hours (though, like most QT films, it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly) strung together by a fairly simple revenge/rescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop; a reasonably similar template to many of Quentin\'s movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds, to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings. Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be, and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie, a contained set-piece all of its own. Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues - rambling shaggy-dog stories, usually - to one another, for context. Not every scene is entirely necessary, either. I wouldn\'t call that a flaw though, I\'d call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino; whether it\'s a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether that\'s an element of Tarantino\'s writing that the viewer appreciates. Personally, I love Tarantino\'s writer\'s voice and I could watch these scenes for hours (indeed, I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday), but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90-minute film that\'s lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are saying.\r\n\r\nPerformances throughout are utterly mesmerising, from stars Foxx and Waltz but also - in fact, maybe more so - from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as \"Monsieur\" Calvin Candie, the horrifying owner of the \"Candyland\" plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Django\'s wife, and Samuel L. Jackson in an if-anything even more monstrous role as Stephen, Candie\'s elderly head house slave, a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slave-in-chief. Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy, a strutting, peacock-like Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers, and delightful in cameo roles are (among many others) James Remar (The Warriors, Dexter), Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Watch), John Jarratt (Wolf Creek, Rogue) and Michael Parks (Red State, Kill Bill). Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and, as usual, he\'s not as charming as he probably thinks he is, but he\'s also not as bad as many think he is, either. There\'s even a quick cameo (raising an involuntary cheer from me!) by Franco Nero, the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci (that\'s not the only nod back to the first Django movie; the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original, and the theme song to Quentin\'s film comes directly from the Corbucci film too).\r\n\r\nDjango Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts; possibly for it\'s incredible levels of bloodshed (one particular gunfight is the most blood-splattered scene I\'ve seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining), and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as \"The \'N\'-word\", uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last. However, neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion. The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality. Heads, arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy, \"BLAAAPP!\" sound effect, the blood itself translucent, syrupy and intentionally unrealistic. And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South, you\'re going to hear the word \"Nigger\" in that tale. Often. Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans, this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic, pig-ignorant white overseers.\r\n\r\nIf you like Tarantino, you\'ll probably like Django Unchained. If you like Westerns (and the blood-drenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular), you\'ll probably like Django Unchained. If, like me, you\'re an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns, this is a no-brainer. Get and see it, it\'s a blast.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to have seen him pull a Gatling gun out of a coffin, though.'),(10055,'Parece que fuera el  sino de la tierra y de los hombres, situacion que es posible observar a traves de la historia universal. Pero no seria posible hacer una película que muestre lo contrario? sería una lección o un modelo para todos en un mundo tan convulsionado?'),(10056,'If you want an action movie, this one really rocks. There are some unneeded clichés but, all in all, is quite an enjoying journey.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and, remarkably, Sharlto Copley perform at great level.'),(10057,'First I want to say I liked this movie. I was surprised, I\'ve been hearing bad reviews but I can\'t see big problem. The only issues was with the story. Apart from that the graphics where very good. The actors where okay (no major actors) and the baddies (no spoilers) where well thought out and graphically impressive (same for the robots).\r\n\r\nAll in all a good movie.'),(10058,'When monstrous, building-sized creatures (dubbed \"kaiju\") hell-bent on destruction begin pouring out of an extra-dimensional fissure at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, humanity bands together to build titanic mechas called jaegers, each controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are linked through a neural bond called \"The Drift.\" As the kaiju get stronger and the signs point to an all-out flood of the beasts, the fate of humanity looks bleak, and the surviving jaegers are brought together for one last-ditch attempt at saving the world.\r\n\r\nAfter an agonizingly long five-year wait, filled with some heartbreaking starts and stops (like the almost-weres of The Hobbit and At the Mountains of Madness), Guillermo del Toro has finally returned with his biggest budget and story yet. The Mexican master of fantasy returns to the toybox of his youth, drawing from the kaiju films of old (Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and the like) and anime to create the modern-day monster movie we didn\'t even know we wanted.\r\n\r\nI am a genre man through and through, and del Toro\'s films are filled with both the intelligence of the best of science fiction, fantasy, and horror and a flawlessly-rendered vision unique to him. His innate knowledge of what makes those outlandish stories truly matter to us is the backbone of his work as a writer and director, and his visual style is one that invokes true wonder.\r\n\r\nIt\'s that wonder, that childlike glee that makes Pacific Rim work so well, and well it does work. This is a brawny, massive film made by a true artist and auteur at the top of his game, but while the technicals of this film could have been mounted by any number of working directors, the magic of Guillermo del Toro is that he infuses every film with himself. His love of the material, whatever it may be, shines brightly through every frame. It is this complete sincerity that makes his films such a joy to experience, and even when there are 250-foot behemoths slugging it out on the screen, there\'s not a trace of the disastrous irony or cynicism so readily supplied by other blockbusters anywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nThe cast gamely comes to play, with Idris Elba (TV’s Luther) as Stacker Pentecost (one of my favorite character names of all time) as the stoic leader of the jaeger program, Charlie Hunnam (TV’s Sons of Anarchy) as former pilot Raleigh Becket, who suffered a tragic loss and has to be convinced to return to jaeger service, and Oscar-nominated Rinko Kinkuchi (Babel) as Mako Mori, another life touched by the kaiju and ready to serve up some righteous fury. If these sound like tried-and-true archetypes, it’s because they are. This is a grand, epic war film on a bigger scale than anything ever attempted before in that genre, and one of the strokes of genius from del Toro and original writer Travis Beacham is that we instantly establish and identify with the characters onscreen. There are so many ideas flying around (monsters, mechas, neural bonding, kaiju culture, and many, many more) that the broadly-drawn characters serve as a perfect anchor for the audience, immediately relatable in their inherent humanity.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the mission statment of this movie was, in a word, “texture.” Del Toro delivered a visual feast unlike any other big spectacle films, with his insistence on it not looking like a “glossy car commercial.” Instead, every frame is filled with rain, snow, scuffs, smoke, debris, and other visual elements that reflect the weight and dimension of these cyclopean combatants. Unlike the ultra-glossy (and emotionally irrelevant) Transformers films, or virtually any other modern big-budget actioner, this universe feels dirty, grungy, and lived-in, like the original Star Wars trilogy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, dubbing a film “this generation’s Star Wars” has been overused to the point of robbing the phrase of all meaning. But Pacific Rim feels just like that. It invokes those most elusive of emotions in the modern studio film: wonder, awe, and sheer enjoyment. Do you remember the awe you felt upon seeing a Star Destroyer creep onto the screen? Discovering a brachiosaurus on Isla Nublar? Laying eyes on the verdant fields of Middle Earth? This film has that. No one builds worlds like del Toro, and here he is, the master, inviting you to play in his sandbox with him. Grab your favorite action figure and hop in.'),(10059,'My favorite movie for years!!!I absolutely love this movie!No big story.A lot of action.The only bad thing is all the fights are at night & in the rain.A bright daylight fight would have really made it great!!!'),(10060,'Overdone movie for children, with tiring tricks thought for 3D but a poor animation that becomes boring for its colorfulness.

But stories about why a revolution is needed are invariably great.  The Hunger Games is such a story.\r\n\r\nThe movie (for the most part), closely follows the book, and does a good job of it.  It also sets up the next book/movie beautifully, even better than the book itself does.\r\n\r\nThe premise, of course, is borrowed from Ancient Rome, when gladiators and/or criminals an/or people whom the emperor wanted killed were forced to fight each other to the death in a public arena for the entertainment of the general populace.  And just as decadent as Rome was back then (only rescued from itself by the rise in prominence of The Christian sect), so the \"Capitol\" is now portrayed in the film/book---and the film portrayed the affluent decadence of the Capitol quite well.\r\n\r\nIn this particular instance the \"tributes\" were chosen at random from among children aged 12 through 18, and it was meant as retribution and reminder of the \"crimes\" the 12 colonies committed by reveling against the authority and rule of the Capitol 74 years ago.  At the public \"reaping\", when a boy and a girl were chosen to become the sacrificial tributes at teach of the 12 colonies, the Decree of Punishment was read and the colonies were reminded that this punishment was established to demonstrate how weak the colonies were in comparison with the Capitol, in that the Capitol could take the most prized possessions of the colonies (namely, their children), and the colonists themselves could do nothing about it.  And to really rub it in, the colonists themselves were forced to watch the tournament proceedings.\r\n\r\nI have to say, the punishment is deviously clever from the point of view of the Capitol.  It certainly keeps the Colonies divided in spirit (they were already segregated physically, with no communication between them allowed by the Capitol), for in cheering for their own children they are therefore cheering for the defeat---and therefore death---of the other colonies\' children.  It also keeps colonists divided within each colony, for there can only be one champion, which means that in wishing their children not to be chosen at the reaping, each colonist is thereby wishing that someone else\'s children be chosen.  Furthermore, in celebrating that their children were not chosen, they are also, incidentally, celebrating that some other person\'s children will likely die.  And for the families of the chosen children, in supporting their own family member during the tournament, they are incidentally supporting the death of the other family\'s child.  And it keeps the population of the colonies low, which the Capitol would want to promote (less chance for another insurrection if the population is low): for the youngest are taken, before they are married, and those who survive the yearly reapings will think twice about having children of their own and having them go through this traumatic process year after year during their most vulnerable adolescent years.  And furthermore, the Capitol encourages the colonists\' tacit endorsement by rewarding the winner\'s Colony with extra food that year (hence \"The \'Hunger\' Games\").  But it is all manipulation, in the end.\r\n\r\nIn fact, by the end of the Games, right before being killed himself, one of the most avid killers among the children realizes just how much it all is the Capitol\'s manipulation, how pointless it all is to those who participate, and how, in the end, he didn\'t really have a chance---that he was destined to die from the beginning---and that killing or being killed is all that not only the Capitol, but also his Colony, want from him.  An eye-opening realization for someone who up to this point had been quite eager to kill his fellow children.\r\n\r\nGiven the vicious circumstances which were thrust upon these children---none of which is their fault---the question naturally arises: how should a child bound under the moral law behave?  Should he try to win, by killing the other children?  Should they try to win at all?  Should they let themselves be killed, in order that another might live?\r\n\r\nOf course, the obvious moral choice would be for none of the children to participate in this horrendous form of reality television: if they do not fight each other the show is not interesting, and eventually it is discontinued.  The children would likely still be executed, along with many of their own family members in reprisal from the Capitol.  If one thinks in terms of consequences only (utilitarianism), then this would be the wrong approach: after all, they would say \"it is better that one person survives than that they---and all their families---die\".  But such thinking is quite repugnant, however logical it is.  Consequentialism is missing a big piece of the moral landscape, namely that we ought not to become evil ourselves in our fight against evil.  Yes, the consequences of \"civil disobedience\" as could morally be practiced in this scenario are more dire in terms of the quantity of damage made.  But they are much more preferable in terms of the quality of damage made.  By fully participating in the carnage (and inflicting some yourself) you become complicit in the very evil which oppresses you.  Similarly, your family, and even your colonies (and all colonies, for that matter) become part of the system, and in some tacit way endorse it---for they all want their children to live, and tacitly support the other colonists\' children\'s death.  Furthermore, what kind of person does one become after killing 23 children by brutal means at a very young age (when the impressions of life still shape us in a powerful manner)?  What kind of society does one help create when one has inwardly become a psychotic monster?  What kind of society abides criminal monsters in its midst?\r\n\r\nBut, some will claim, it is unrealistic to expect each and every child to be morally minded, especially when some children (from two different colonies which are highly favored by the Capitol) actually volunteered for the \"honor\" to represent their colonies at the tournament.  What is the correct moral response when civil disobedience is not an option (no opportunity) and some, if not most of the other children are out to kill you, whether by pleasure or need to survive?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there are two possible moral responses.  one of them is the route of self-defense, whereby one does not intentionally kill or go out of one\'s way to engage the enemy, but tries to flee as a first alternative, BUT where one DOES defend oneself against the attacks of others, and inflicts only as much harm as is necessary to stop the aggressor, AND only if absolutely necessary one uses lethal force.  In the end, very likely, the Capitol would force matters to a resolution, either by forcing \"aggressors\" and \"defensors\" into a particular area (very good television), or by artificially creating natural/artificial disasters which killed whomever they disliked most.  But, again, this would be the Capitol\'s doing: an evil force acting evilly which one cannot stop.  One would have been preserved from sinking to doing/becoming evil.\r\n\r\nThe other moral route, the more perfect route, would be the route of Jesus: to willfully become the sacrificial lamb for the sake of spiritual (and therefore) moral change.  The martyrs of the Church have for ages followed this route, to the spiritual benefit of the whole Church, and the cultural benefit of all humanity.  The spiritual benefit is quite and readily seen through the Communion of Saints, whereby these martyr\'s love renews and creates the Church anew, greatly adding to the spiritual gifts of which the rest of us partake---gifts which slowly transform us for the better, over years and generations.  And it is this transformation which over the centuries affects culture.  Gradually better people live their lives out in gradually better communities.  And Love wins out at the end of time.  After all, very few societies nowadays would consider it acceptable to inflict the tortures which were inflicted to prisoners (especially Christians) in the ancient days of Rome: we are all repulsed by the Capitol\'s Decree of Punishment.  If we only partook more of those graces which Christ offers through His Church!\r\n\r\nOne particular odd feature of the book (and the film) is the avoidance of any mention of God or religion whatsoever.  Not even empty phrases deriving from religion appear (\"My Gosh\", \"God willing\", Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.).  Why is that, especially when the subject matter so clearly lends itself to a religious treatment?  Why is that, when the least historically educated among us would have heard the stories of the Christians ushered into the Colosseum to be executed/sacrificed?  The closest religious reference is when Katniss Everdeen improvises a type of tribute around a fallen friend and ally in the game by creating a bed of flowers for her: the very earliest expressions of the religious impulse, as some Anthropologists would tell us.  Why has the author scrubbed her book from religion at all?  Is she so antagonistic to religion that she will not abide it in her book, even when it seems quite apt?  If so, the bed of flowers tell us that the most primitive of religious impulses remain with her still.  Or is the author trying to appeal to everyone, thus removing religion from the surface of her story so as to not alienate people of different religion than the one she chose to portray, while at the same time infusing her work with religious themes at the substrate level, where they are more powerful?  Or is her point that the despotic Capitol destroyed all hope quite successfully, even the Hope of God?  Given the richness of the religious themes I see in this book/movie below the surface, I am very much inclined to believe that the last of these options is the correct one.  But I may be seeing what I want to see, simply because I like the story.\r\n\r\nNow, turning to the more artistic features of the movie: The most impressive performance was done by the actor who played President Snow.  His facial expressions were insuperable and spoke tons in the few lines he delivered throughout the film.  His performance was astoundingly good, his face delivering contempt, skepticism, and hatred (sometimes all at once) along with the \"weight of office\" while speaking seemingly innocuous lines, or even while congratulating the winners (there were two winners from District 12, thanks to the cleverness of Katniss Everdeen in turning the television show against its organizers!) of the 74th Hunger Games.  He single-handedly set up the next movie installment.\r\n\r\nBut the casting of Peeta is all wrong.  From the book it is clear that Peeta is not handsome at all, that Peeta is the boring guy who never had a chance when it came to women, and who doesn\'t have a chance when it comes to Katniss Everdeen who clearly has feelings for another guy.  Which makes it all the more poignant that he is desperately in love with her, and is willing to give up his life for her.  In the movie he is played by a movie-star-handsome actor who clearly would have trouble keeping women away from him, and who would therefore be quite self-centered and clueless, rather than the thoughtful man he is in the book.'),(10065,'The special effects are great, the scenery and photography is lovely but the film is as a whole a big disappointment.

The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. \r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. What a joke.

Why would you want to watch any Resident Evil movie come to think about? Good acting…nope. Intelligent and intriguing plot…absolutely not. Zombies…yep. Action…most definitely yes! Anything else…well if you’re member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.\r\n\r\nNow that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.\r\n\r\nI think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvellous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I’m hardly among the younger part f the mail audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill’s chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like “did you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards”.\r\n\r\nI cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars.

Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.\r\n\r\nThis one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so… Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.\r\n\r\nThe movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.'),(10077,'Great Comeback for Arnold.

Not as good as the first one. Yes, I am sad to say it is not as good but on the other hand the story is still sound and the action is better and faster then before. Liam Neeson plays his role excellently while some on the other cast members didn\'t preform as well. All in all a good movie but there are some little problems, but worth seeing any way.'),(10081,'I enjoyed this movie as a no-brainer action/thriller flick. Sure, it has a bunch of illogical and idiotic elements in but I have seen a lot worse. The movie certainly do not deserve the ridiculously low ratings that some people have given it.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not as good as the first movie, mostly due to the silly bits and pieces, but as a plain vanilla action/thriller it is certainly passable. I generally do like Liam Neeson. I did like him in the first Taken movie and I do like him in this one. The other actors with the possible exception of his wife and daughter are mostly there to fill up the scenes.\r\n\r\nAfter a semi-dull beginning which is pretty much just setting up a reason for them all being in Istanbul, Bryan and his wife is, surprise, surprise, taken and that is pretty much when the action starts and from there on it is pretty much action all the way.\r\n\r\nAs have been mentioned, there are a lot of stupid things happening in the movie. Dropping grenades in the middle of Istanbul seemingly without anyone really reacting for instance. Bryan’s daughter have failed to take a drivers licence in the states several times but still, when thrown into a car with a manual gear stick, she handles the car like a stunt driver. Then we have a violin player that sits in the same spot all the time? Not to mention crashing into the embassy while being fired upon by the embassy marine guards and then they can just sit there in the wrecked car, in front of the embassy, while Bryan calls for help from some guy playing golf in the states.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Luc Besson didn’t really put realism very high on his agenda for this movie. But then this wouldn’t be the first time for him. Overlook the silliness and you have a decent enough action/thriller flick. At least I enjoyed it and I am normally not too forgiving when it comes to stupid and unrealistic stuff in movies.'),(10082,'Not too bad but a bit too cheesy and stereotypical.'),(10083,'Wreck-It Ralph is a great movie with my love for games in there with it. The movie had some great childhood memories of mine, with all the characters from the best games. The graphics are excellent and the voice acting couldn\'t be better. This movie is great for adults and kids.'),(10084,'> Good Movie !!'),(10085,'Amazing movie!These Fast & Furious movies keep getting better and better! I recommend you go see this movie and hopefully seven comes out!'),(10086,'This is a good movie. It is pretty much what you would expect from a Fast & Furious movie. It could have been a great movie but it is unfortunately dragged down by some of the not too unusual Hollywood stupidity and arrogance towards the viewers.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson are perfect in their roles as old-fashioned, hard-hitting, fast-driving macho guys. Michel Rodriquez is doing a decent enough job as well but then I do like Michel Rodriquez so… These guys are making a lot of the movie for me. The rest is not bad but more like filling out some empty space compared to Vin and Dwayne.\r\n\r\nThis is of course a movie about fast driving, action and special effects. In those areas it does not disappoint. There are lots of fast driving and lots of action and special effects. Not all of it is entirely realistic of course. This is rather expected and I can live with it as long as it doesn’t go to far into the realm of ludicrously unrealistic which it, sadly, did towards the end. Although the effects and fights themselves were quite cool the entire flight escape scene was just ludicrous. They were driving at take-off speed, both on the ground and in the air, for how long? 20 minutes? That must have been the worlds longest runway. This is what I call Hollywood arrogance towards the viewers. Do they really think the viewers are so stupid that they will just buy this? Or is it that they themselves are so utterly stupid that they do not realize how utterly wrong the entire thing is? For me this really dragged down an otherwise great movie.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the movie is a nice blend between macho talk, action, lots of fast driving, some humor, some more action, some more fast driving and lots of chars getting smashed. In short all the things that make up a good fun action movie. The story itself? Well, as far as I am concerned, fairly standard issue which held the action together reasonably although the basic idea and technical aspects, especially this “EMP chip”, where not very believable.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was a good and enjoyable movie which good have been great if it were not dragged down by Hollywood stupidity.'),(10087,'Interesting film with an exceptional cast, fantastic performances and characterizations.

Sure, the Cavendish story was pure comedy but the rest of the stories just didn\'t feel serious enough to me.\r\n\r\nIt carried my attention for the 172 minutes well enough and it was entertaining. I just expected more of a pay off at the end.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it\'s definitely worth seeing but I still haven\'t made up my mind if I truly liked it or not. What did you think?'),(10089,'nice movie'),(10090,'After trying to move the character to more epic levels in ‘Chronicles of Riddick’, and failing to capture an audience, this third installment in the series, simply titled ‘Riddick’,  is a return-to-basics for director David Twohy. It quickly sets itself loose from the baggage of ‘Chronicles’ and pursues a more clear-cut survival action story that might as well be titled ‘Pitch Black 2‘.'),(10091,'Three years ago, Despicable Me launched Illumination Entertainment and announced Universal Studios as a viable player in the animation game (only Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks used to show up to these box-office battles). The film wasn\'t even the only supervillain animation to hit the theaters that year, but it did one-up its rival Megamind both in critical acclaim and commercial success.\r\n\r\nNow, the original film\'s creative team returns with Despicable Me 2, continuing the adventures of former supervillain-cum-adopted father Gru, his precocious daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and his little, yellow, nonsense-spouting minions. Following closely on the first film\'s heels (this film gratifyingly puts a premium on continuity), the now-retired Gru is settling into his new paternal role, and while the spikier parts of his personality remain, he\'s reshaped himself into an adoring father and potential purveyor of jams (and jellies). When an evil plot threatens the globe, however, Gru finds himself pulled back into the supervillain game by the Anti-Villain League, who\'ve recruited him to be the hero, an ersatz spy who knows how the mystery bad guy thinks. One earnest and delightfully overbearing partner introduction later, the pair (Gru and newbie AVL agent Lucy Wilde, played by Kristen Wiig) are undercover as bakers in a strip mall where the bad guy\'s scheme is likely to go down.\r\n\r\nDespite the world being threatened, the stakes feel surprisingly low in the film; the archness of the plot never feels as real or immediate as the character interactions, which are enjoyable all the way through. Here, Gru realizes his loneliness, his neophyte partner realizes her true calling, and his daughters come to grips with new realizations and wishes. The characters take center stage, rarely letting the transparently-raised stakes of the plot machinations get in the way of sitcom-like character arcs such as the eldest daughter dating (and Gru\'s dogged insistence on undermining it) or little Agnes wanting a new mother. But that\'s sort of the magic of these films; despite the plot beats being the stuff of basic sitcoms, the setting and characters manage to still make the film a winning combination.\r\n\r\nSteve Carell dusts off the strange Eastern European accent he originated for Gru, and manages to be both an amusing character and his own straight man. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher embody adorableness as the girls. But it\'s Wiig who steals the show as Agent Wilde, a professional woman who is also goofy and personable. Wiig and Carell have fantastic chemistry, even with just their voices in play.\r\n\r\nThe minions, those little yellow blobs in overalls that accompany all of the film\'s publicity, are back and hilarious as ever, despite their laser-like focus on slapstick and complete lack of intelligible dialogue. The Despicable films seem to be two separate animation genres welded together: the first is a heartfelt, Pixarian meditation on the nature of family, but the second is the part with the minions, which embody the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes more successfully than any of their predecessors. It\'s a strange melange that shouldn\'t work, but dammit, it does, and the resulting films wound up being both moving and guffaw-inducing.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of the Despicable films that bowls me over is the virtual cinematography; truly, alongside the best of Pixar\'s output (like Wall-E), these are some of the most beautiful animated films ever made. The use of color, depth, and art are stunning, from Gru\'s Charles Addams-inspired design to the beautiful play of light, shadow, and color. This sequel follows the high standards of the first, and the result is a feast for the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that like the first film, this one is a trifle, but a very enjoyable one. It\'s little more than a victory lap for Carell and company, but when there are characters you can enjoy this much, what\'s wrong with spending another couple of hours with them?'),(10092,'Awesome, the best racing movie since grand prix '),(10093,'It’s simultaneously a blessing and a curse that I often wind up seeing films post-theatrical release. Even though I don’t intentionally seek out spoilers (OK, I do, but I’m getting better about it), I do still read reviews of films. The best reviews convey two things: 1) what the author thought of the film in question, and 2) enough information to give the reader an informed opinion as to whether or not said reader will enjoy the film, regardless of the author’s response.\r\n\r\nThose reviews, coupled with the near-unanimous praise the film has received from all quarters caused me to believe that I would fall in love with this film, becoming swept up in its high-tension, immaculately-crafted story of the hunt for, and eventual assassination of, master terrorist Osama bin Laden.\r\n\r\nI was so very, very wrong.\r\n\r\nIt starts well enough: under a black screen, a restrained opening plays audio (I do not know if it was real or dramatized) of phone calls placed on September 11, 2001 as the terrorist attacks that brought down the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were occurring. The film then introduces us to Maya (Jessica Chastain), one of many CIA workers tasked with finding the man responsible for those terrorist attacks. We follow Maya over the next twelve years, seeing small glimpses of her as she grows from determined but unsure interrogator to a woman whose sole reason in life is the location and capture of Osama bin Laden.\r\n\r\nThe film was in production for a long time, and the ending had to be hastily rewritten to account for the real-life assault on the bin Laden compound, which resulted in his death. What a boon this became for the film (to say nothing of the country as a whole), as the thirty-minute compound assault that serves as the film’s final act is a breathtaking, tour-de-force whirlwind, following Seal Team Six into the dark den of the most notorious terrorist in American history and emerging victorious.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the two hours preceding that astonishing climax is unforgivably dull, lacking almost completely in character development and good writing, and structured with the worst possible way in which to tell this epic and (potentially) fascinating story.\r\n\r\nChastain, one of the best actresses of her generation, vacillates between being utterly terrific (attempting to convince her superiors of her lead, her final scene) and sadly miscast. Chastain is an actress of uncommon grace and beauty, and trying to put her in the role of an embittered federal agent simply doesn’t work. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but the script (more on that in a moment) simply gives them nothing to do. At least the SEALs fare slightly better, with Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt (from TV’s \'Parks & Recreation\') crafting positive impressions from their slivers of dialogue.\r\n\r\nOh, that script. Written by journalist Mark Boal (Oscar-winning screenwriter of Bigelow’s \'The Hurt Locker\'), it is a cacophony of crap. The dialogue is inane (“Bin Laden is there. And you’re going to kill him for me.”), the characters are flat, lifeless, and uninteresting, and most unforgivably, it takes what should have been a massively satisfying story (the hard-won retribution visited upon the monster that killed 3,000 innocent Americans), and trivialized it to nothing than the personal investment of a single person spurred by the death of a couple of coworkers during the twelve-year-long search. I understand that the search for bin Laden was over a decade of boredom and legwork, punctuated only by intermittent threats (most of which felt cooked up specifically for the film, despite those setpieces paling to what I can only imagine the real scenarios must have been like). But Bigelow’s insistence on conveying that to the viewers by boring them to tears as well is not an effective recipe for drama.\r\n\r\nIn a way, it’s the inverse of Steven Spielberg’s \'Saving Private Ryan\'. \'Ryan\' is a not a good film (the screenplay is utter dreck), but the skill, inventiveness, and sheer directorial talent on display in that phenomenal opening sequence catapult it to being on the greatest scenes in cinema history. Here, Bigelow stages her own version at the end of her film, and the results are equally gripping and visceral. On the basis of that one scene alone, Bigelow (much like Spielberg) deserved inclusion in the Academy’s nominees for Best Director. Outside of that, however, I find the critical acclaim of the film to be completely mystifying. The movie as a whole is rotten to its poorly-written core, a waste of money, and a diminishment of one of the best real-life stories of modern times. If you can, pop in for the last reel, but spend the other two hours watching something better.'),(10094,'Good :3'),(10095,'Awesome movie!'),(10096,'The Wolf of Wall Street is so addicting to watch, that even with it\'s 3 hour long run time, you wont be surprised if you end up watching it four days in a row. <br>\r\n     This is Scorsese letting loose and having fun, showing all of the debauchery (and man, is there a lot) in all of it\'s glory. There are orgies, sex, nudity, copious amounts of drug use, and it now holds the record for the most use of fuck in any film. <br>\r\n     Leonardo DiCaprio gives a towering and hilarious performance as Jordan Belfort. He throws himself into the role with free abandon, while also showing that he\'s aces when it comes to comic timing and physical comedy. If he doesn\'t win an Oscar this season I\'ll be quite upset, though Matt from Dallas Buyers Club rightfully deserves it as well. But this is a 3 hour long film, and Leo is in every single second of every single scene. He\'s ferocious, hilarious, out of his mind, and flat out brilliant.<br>\r\n     The supporting players are tops as well. I was somewhat baffled when Jonah Hill earned a nominee for Moneyball, but this time around he rightfully deserves this years nominations. With his pearly white teeth, charisma, while also throwing himself into the role with no fear, this is without a doubt his greatest work as an actor to date. The real find, however, is Margot Robbie. Strikingly beautiful, her character could have been one note, but she also hits the ball out of the court. Even Matthew Macconaughey steals the show with only one scene. <br>\r\n     Dangerously funny, superbly edited, and with a delicious, irreverent, savage bite. The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese at his wildest. And it goes without saying, that this is one of the best films of last year.

But the downfall of the film was its lazy writing.\r\n\r\nAlmost no part of Olympus Has Fallen is remotely believable. A single airplane penetrates into protected airspace around Washington D.C. and riddles the White House with bullets. It takes 15 minutes for armed reinforcements to arrive. The President of the United States risks the annihilation of a peaceful ally nation to prevent an acquaintance of his from being beaten up. I could go on. And on.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the movie is somewhat painful to watch. You will certainly find yourself complaining loudly at the screen. And yet the action is riveting. Watch this movie, then try to forget it. 5.5/10.'),(10103,'Cute and fun, with great cast and performances and nice English humor.\r\n\r\nJust, it is too good, too neat ... but a good movie for getting out of the theater with optimism and faith in life.'),(10104,'I have not read the books. Judging by the reviews from people who have read them that seems to be a good thing as most of them seem to complain that the movie is not a good representation of the books. Then, when looking at the book ratings at Goodreads there seems to be a rather large spread between reviews loving the book and reviews hating it.\r\n\r\nIf I had read the books I would expect them to sit on my young adult shelf in Goodreads. At least the movie is clearly for a teenage audience. Nevertheless it is quite entertaining as far as I am concerned. A bit silly and predictable at times but still entertaining. I would even call it a family movie although there where some scenes that might be a bit scary for the youngest ones in the family.\r\n\r\nThe story is yet another variant of the classical young girl or boy discovers that there are things that go bump in the night and also that she is part of those things. I have to say that I quite like those kind of stories.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote I found the movie quite entertaining but, although I cannot say that I have anything specific to complain, the movie never really lifts itself above the average crowd of entertaining movies. The special effects are ok but nothing more, the acting is average, the story is okay and so on. It was enjoyable 130 minutes and I never felt bored but I never went wow either.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it never became clear to me why this episode was called City of Bones though.

As he goes about his business, he has to stay two steps ahead of the police and his military employers who want their lethal weapon back.\r\n\r\nSlow justice is better than no justice.\r\n\r\nOK! Lets cut to the chase here, this is ultimately a gruesome revenge picture, the only thing new on offer here is the methods of the executions administered by the seriously brooding Jimmy Vickers. This adherence to formula, a basic modern update of the Death Wish filmic telling of a tale, is enough to send many critics scurrying around for their most poisonous pens with which to articulate their venom. Add in the Danny Dyer factor, a fella who strangely seems to rile so many in entertainment circles purely because of the genre branches of entertainment he works in, then Vendetta was never going to garner favourable reviews in many quarters.\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t revenge. This is a necessity.\r\n\r\nYet there\'s a question that springs to mind here, namely, what were they expecting? Tag lines and media headings said Danny Dyer enacts bloody revenge on the murderers of his parents because the law is an ass! Do critics and film fans really go into a film like this, one that isn\'t hiding under false pretences, expecting a scathing and intelligent observation on the lawlessness of Britain? Or a snarky aside to the failings of the law system? Seriously? Stephen Reynolds (writer and director) has put some thought into his picture, there are some potent passages of dialogue, even if they fall by the wayside as the kills come thick and fast, but it was never marketed to the highbrow seekers.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll be demoted before you can say Katie Price is a virgin.\r\n\r\nVendetta delivers the goods for those looking for a good night in with a beer and some blood and brooding on the screen. Dyer (a real nice bloke in real life) gives good value as a son hell bent on revenge, whilst he also doesn\'t look out of place in his fight scenes. Haider Zafar\'s cinematography is superb, the blues and golds magnetic in their visual appeal, and there\'s good and solid work done by the supporting cast. \r\n\r\nVendetta has fans, it really does, so much so that a sequel is currently in production. That news is sure to send those critics sitting up there in their ivory towers at The Guardian and The Telegraph crying over their shrimp salads. But you can bet your last British pound that they will be going to view the sequel expecting a far different movie to the one the man and woman of the street knows they are going to get.
